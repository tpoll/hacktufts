Hacked together with Emma, Riley, and Alex

Confess Bot is an automated facebook bot that posted
"appropriate" songs onto various facebook confession pages.
It makes use of the facebook graph api,  the echonest api, and the uclassify learning api

Alletehdat was a 4:30 in the morning inspired simple sorting
of all the Tuft's confessions posts. After gather every post, I combined the messages 
into a single test file and then sorted to get the 100 most common words.
For fun, I created a poem  using those 100 words (order is preserved).
