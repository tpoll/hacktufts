SJWs don\'t try to affect change in the world, they just complain about things that they disagree with. Also, I think this is an opportunity to define what SJW means to people (like myself) that disparage their way of thinking. To me, an SJW is a person who engages in discourse about hot-button issues without valid experience or education on the issue, and does little to actually affect change in whatever particular thing they are complaining about today. Tumblr is both a resource and platform to them; they rely on the shared, unreliable information of this social media platform to support their arguments, and then make posts viewed mainly by like-minded followers rather than engaging in meaningful discourse with those who may disagree.  They are stubborn to the point of intolerance; they outright refuse to listen to dissenting opinions. They behave as though their thoughts on broad social issues are absolute truth; if you disagree, you are wrong or ignorant. They have no first-person perspective on the causes they so loudly champion; white people demand the end of racism, women from sheltered, wealthy, successful backgrounds beg for the destruction of rape culture and the growth of equal opportunities, heterosexual individuals cry over the plight of the LGBT community. While it\'s great to be an ally, shouting so loudly for people you have probably never made an effort to meet seems patronizing to me. They have little real-world engagement, acting as though one more reblog, one more BuzzFeed article, one more Facebook tirade will bring about the change they so desperately want. My biggest issue with SJW culture is that it\'s a fad. These are high school kids and naive young adults who flock to the SJW movement not because they truly see injustice in the world, but because it\'s the cool thing to do. These are not people disadvantaged by society, these are armchair philosophers, Internet heroes. They are sheep, easily guided and influenced, docile and hard to take seriously. They are hypocrites, false prophets, and, to me, more offensive than the misogynists, racists, and homophobes they think they\'re fighting.

The world wont change without people actively trying to change it. If you disagree with them that\'s one thing, but just because you are apathetic, it does not mean that the people who are passionate are inferior to you.

Meanwhile, straight white men will be attacked for no apparent reason. Last I checked, that\'s called discrimination, and it works both ways. If a female minority student on this campus had been accused (but not found guilty) of sexual assault, and the university provided a ""warning"" to other students, there would be all kinds of outrage about her rights. Since it\'s the other way around, and this is a white male in question, he\'s inherently guilty and pretty much the devil himself. Oh, haven\'t you heard that straight white men are the new ultimate evil? It doesn\'t matter if he wasn\'t convicted.

Whenever, I go out with my friends, I rarely get hit on, if at all, and I consider myself a pretty good looking girl. And you know what\'s even worse? When a white guy hits on you or wants to hook up with you because he\'s never fucked a black girl before or he\'s says ""ooh I bet you\'re freaky in bed because you\'re a black"" or something like that, as if I\'m some nasty video vixen with a big ass that\'s just ready to fuck everything and anything. I\'ve white guys say these things to me, and it makes me feel like I\'m some kind of silly novelty that can bought in a store or something. It\'s absolutely shitty. Before they even get to know who I am, they just think of me as something new and fun to fuck. It really hurts my feelings, but I\'ve also met non-black guys who really want to get to know me and realize I\'m as cool as shit, open-minded, and friendly and love the color of my skin and my hair, so all hope is not lost.

What I mean is that, while I am ALWAYS accepting of other people and their cultures, and I am ALWAYS capable of becoming romantically/emotionally attracted to a person of another race, I find it difficult to feel sexual/physical attraction to people of certain races.  This has NOTHING to do with racial/cultural background, it\'s based entirely on physical features/appearance.  Isn\'t that what all sexual/physical attraction is based on anyway?  There are some physical features that most of our society has agreed are ""sexually attractive"", such as large breasts, defined muscles, or smooth skin. There are some features whose attractiveness differ from person to person but are still very common components in determining physical attraction (e.g. short vs long hair, physical height).  And then there are features that only make a difference to some people, such as hair/eye color or the presence of tattoos/piercings, that we accept simply as unusual turn-ons and turn-offs.  There are many physical features that are common within specific races/ethnicities (such as hairstyle, skin color, eye shape, etc) that fall into one of the latter two categories.  (This, of course, is not to say that everyone of a specific ethnicity possesses certain physical characteristics, nor that they are the only people who possess those traits; I\'m only saying some traits are common within certain races.)  Sometimes, the combination of physical traits that form a person\'s individual sexual preference happen to overlap with the physical traits that many people of a specific race possess and may be virtually opposite the physical traits that many people of another race possess.  This is why one person, regardless of their own race, may find him/herself attracted primarily to, say, black and Asian people, but rarely to white and Middle Eastern people.  Or maybe he/she will be attracted almost exclusively to Indian people, because the physical traits that he/she finds attractive are possessed by many Indian people, or she finds it difficult to feel attracted to Hispanic people because the traits he/she considers turn-offs are prevalent among Hispanic people. This person may be able to fall in love with someone with any of these ethnic backgrounds, but may not be physically attracted to them enough to hook up with with them at a party.\n\nSorry this was so long, so tl;dr: It\'s hormones, not personal racism."', 'id': u'117787288404239_205381326311501', 'ids': [u'205381326311501_476446']}, {'created_time': u'2013-10-20T18:50:40+0000', 'message': u'"Hey, do any of the girls at Tufts go for bad boys?\n\nCuz, well, I don\'t mean to brag, but this one time, I only looked one way before I crossed the street ;)"', 'id': u'117787288404239_205381282978172', 'ids': [u'205381282978172_476705', u'205381282978172_476415']}, {'created_time': u'2013-10-20T18:50:34+0000', 'message': u'Who is the footballer with dark curly hair', 'id': u'117787288404239_205381262978174', 'ids': [u'205381262978174_476409', u'205381262978174_476720', u'205381262978174_476507']}, {'created_time': u'2013-10-20T18:50:28+0000', 'message': u'"""Is it really that big a deal to do away with the R word and stick to words that are still perfectly good for describing negative situations without being ableist?""\n\nExactly!

Yes of course there are conditions that affect this, but the fact that people say things like """"well some skinny people eat as much as fat people"""" demonsteates a lack of understanding about how metabolisms work. If you have a slower metabolism, don\'t eat as much as someone with a faster metabolism, and then complain when you gain weight.\nI\'m not saying that this excuses being rude to people because of their weight, of course it doesn\'t, everyone deserves respect. But don\'t act like weight is something you have no control over. It\'s not the same as skin color or sexuality.""\n\nI know there has been a bunch said about fat shaming, etc. I was 40 pounds or so overweight in high school. Never got the guy, was always the funny one, horror show shopping experiences. I hated the phrase, ""big girl""- it was always me, no matter who I was with. I put in a long summer of hard work to reshape my eating habits and working out, but that still didn\'t quite change things until I found my sweet spot- I\'m happier now with my body than I have ever been. But telling people who have difficulty controlling how much they eat is TOO easy when you don\'t get the same insane cravings. You\'re so hungry, you hate yourself for wanting food, but in this self-hatred have learned to turn to things that are not good for you. Not everyone understands- eat less is easy to SAY when you don\'t know the pain of fixation and hunger that some people simply can\'t control. \n\nOn a separate note, read ""Why We Get Fat"" by Gary Taubes. Gives a little insight into why the whole notion of ""eat less, move more"" was a misguided trend that has gained WAY too much traction. Listening to him changed my body and changed my life.

All I said was that being at an unhealthy weight (either overweight or underweight) is extremely dangerous and unhealthy as your risk for many health problems greatly increase. Being overweight is no one else\'s fault but yours- take responsibility for it instead of being butthurt about when a bunch of immature assholes made fun of your weight- why do you care what they think? For the minority of actually overweight people that have actual digestive problems like hypothyroidism, there are many medications that treat those health problems, so those of you who decide to play the ""muh metabolism"" or ""I have a bad thyroid"" card when you most likely don\'t and can\'t even locate where your thryoid is, there are even cures to those diseases.\n\nI\'m not trying to say that fat people should be ashamed for who they are and their habits, all I\'m saying is we shouldn\'t be rewarding and supporting people who live unhealthy lifestyles. If you truly want a change in your life and to lose weight, the way to do it is very simple- you need to change the way you diet and exercise. Calculate your TDEE (the amount of calories you need to eat in one day to maintain your weight) and simply eat 200-500 calories below it every day, and also take 30 minutes out of your day to go for a walk or light jog. It\'s never too late and there\'s no excuse- I know people who\'ve gone from over 800 pounds who\'ve literally lost hundreds of pounds of weight (I personally know them, not people from a TV show).\n\ninb4 ""ZOMG UR SO HATEFUL CHECK YOUR THIN PRIVELEGE"""', 'id': u'117787288404239_204184696431164', 'ids': [u'204184696431164_470118']}, {'created_time': u'2013-10-16T19:30:34+0000', 'message': u"You'll be happy to know that I've gotten over the biting coldness of you not caring about me.

It was an awesome relationship. I\'ve never felt more fulfilled by my relationship with another person. \n\nWhen we got into college, (she also got into Tufts, fun fact) we realized we were not going to go to the same school, and that we would be even farther from each other than we were already. We would see each other even less. We didn\'t want that for ourselves. We didn\'t want to stress our relationship like that. So, we broke it off to protect ourselves and to keep our relationship as idyllic in our memories as it could be, instead of letting distance tear it apart. \n\nThat isn\'t to say long distance relationships don\'t work, but A) there\'s way more temptation in college, and B) it isn\'t the same when you don\'t go home to the same place. The little time we have off is spent with family, not each other, and those two things are mutually exclusive because of distance.\n\nThat said, I already know how fulfilling a relationship that you put effort into can be. And I am sure that I will want that back, in time.\n\nBut right now, it hasn\'t been long enough for me to move on like that, and sometimes I want to skip the emotional foreplay and get straight to the sexual foreplay instead.

Maybe she just wants to get to know you a little better. Don\'t be frightened away by the smallest hint of attraction. I think a lot of you are afraid of the responsibilities that come with being in a relationship, but many girls don\'t need you to be doting on them 24/7 and also don\'t want to have all those responsibilities...they just want to feel cared about by someone they care about!\n\nSooooo do us single ladies a favor and give us a chance!\n"', 'id': u'117787288404239_203619826487651', 'ids': [u'203619826487651_466964', u'203619826487651_466818']}, {'created_time': u'2013-10-14T21:33:03+0000', 'message': u'This weekend I got blackout drunk and had sex with some guy.

I\'m rusty and I know it, so for now, I\'ve been getting involved in other ways. \n\nOverall, 3Ps and its component organizations are very friendly places, and it\'s not hard to find people you\'ll get along with. And let me speak from experience with board members I\'ve worked with directly before; Cole is one of the nicest, most honest, grounded people I\'ve met here. I had a small technical role on the show he directed last fall and yet he always knows who I am and calls me by name. If 3Ps was really a ""boys club"" where only a select few are important I don\'t think this would happen. Evey, who assistant directed the same show, can be slightly intimidating with her sharp wit and sarcastic sense of humor but she is very accommodating and approachable one you look past that.\n\nReally, my biggest concern is that people feel this way and apparently would rather express it through anonymous confessions and op-ed articles in a campus newspaper that won\'t even publish a response. Why haven\'t you talked to anyone on the board or in the cast of Eurydice? (Since that seems to be the production you\'re most upset about. Which, by the way, there are many other opportunities apart from the major production.) The only thing you\'re accomplishing is driving away possible newcomers instead of getting real answers; I guess it\'s just the case that misery loves company.\n\n""I like that in 3P\'s response to the Op-Ed about them, they don\'t confirm or even deny that their Fall Show was pre-cast. They telling people that\'s its ok to audition for show but if the show is pre-cast, what\'s the point?

Over and over again. (The jealousy, not the cool international trips). I\'m one of those people who gets like, 92% of my tuition paid because of how not-rich I am :P.\n\n In high school I started dating someone of what I would call upper-middle class. I walked into his 2-story house (not a mansion or anything) and just kept gasping at everything I saw. The hot tub, the fancy kitchen with one of those ""island counters"" in the middle. Everything amazed me. Now, I\'m used to it. It\'s completely normal. Staying in the house they own at the Cape amazed me at first (like what? You have enough money to pay for TWO houses?!). Now it\'s normal. I know we come from very different backgrounds, but maybe it\'s good that we haven\'t experienced EVERYTHING yet. Maybe it\'s good that we aren\'t SO rich that we stop being able to take in how amazing some things truly are. Like if we ever study abroad at Tufts, that experience would stand out in our minds as something REALLY special, rather than ""just another trip."" \n\nAnd trust me.

I just have a lot of feelings (reference intended) and it always seems bizarre to me that some people can be less caught up in their own internal dialogue. I want to be able to connect with other people on a deeper level. I know this sounds really intense, and that\'s not exactly how I mean it to be perceived, but it\'s basically how I feel. So much of my daily life seems filled with going through the motions of socializing and in the end its so pointless. Its not even enjoyable, its tiring. Someone complains about something--you express fake dismay/sympathy. Someone gets an A on their midterm and you pretend like you give a shit. Someone tells an anecdote from their childhood and you feign interest. At the end of it all you are no closer to the other person. And perhaps my disinterest lies in the fact that I\'m a bit of a narcissist, but I honestly have the ability to care about other people. Its just that so many people aren\'t worth it. I feel like a lot of people are bullshit. I\'m bullshit sometimes. I just feel like its important that we\'re able to recognize this in ourselves. I want to know people who can spot the bullshit in themselves and others, because to me those are the only people worth knowing. \n"', 'id': u'117787288404239_202250979957869', 'ids': [u'202250979957869_460173', u'202250979957869_460274', u'202250979957869_460276', u'202250979957869_460226']}, {'created_time': u'2013-10-10T18:01:20+0000', 'message': u'a mile and a half on a bus takes a long time', 'id': u'117787288404239_202250903291210', 'ids': []}, {'created_time': u'2013-10-10T18:01:15+0000', 'message': u"I don't think there's anything more embarrassing than white people trying to twerk or constantly making jokes about it because they only just discovered it exists.", 'id': u'117787288404239_202250883291212', 'ids': []}, {'created_time': u'2013-10-10T18:01:09+0000', 'message': u"Are there any other Ska fans at Tufts?

It is an opinion; an argument against the concept of dis-investment (or divestment) as it is known here at Tufts. I write this not to attack or belittle those involved in the movement, rather, to introduce another perspective on the issue. I both acknowledge and understand that everybody is entitled to their own opinions; I simply wish to draw attention to a couple of important points that may or may not be overlooked when it comes to debate on dependency on fossil fuels, climate change and the Tufts endowment. \n\nFirstly, there is no denying that fossil fuels are bad for the environment. I don\u2019t think anybody can (or should) argue that. The data stands before us; the carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels harm the environment. That being said, it does not mean that Tufts should discontinue their investment from fossil fuel companies. Please allow me to elaborate.\n\nThe Tufts University Endowment, the last time I checked, was $1.6 billion dollars. After speaking to the Tufts Investment Office (the men and women responsible for investing our endowment), I learned that about 20% of our funds are invested in fossil fuel companies. They did not disclose the names of said companies, but if I were to venture a guess, all of these companies would be someplace on the top 50 of the Fortune 500 list.\n\nThere is a reason that Tufts chooses to invest in these companies, the reason being: they are profitable. The purpose of investing an endowment is to make it grow. Our endowment is then used to build better facilities, allocate more funds to financial aid to help students get a world-class education, et cetera. The truth is, investing in these companies generate revenue and a good return for our endowment, which is why we\u2019ve continued to do so.\n\nI have spoken to those in favor of Divestment, and I have heard the argument being made that alternative energy is a rapidly growing sector that we ought to take advantage of. In the last year, over $260 million dollars was invested into this sector. Those in favor of divestment have used this statistic to help make their argument a more convincing one. And on the face of it, it may seem rather convincing. After all, if the sector is growing at such a rate, would it not be a better idea for Tufts to invest in these alternative energy companies, see amazing returns and be a socially-responsible institution? I would argue yes, if that were actually the case. Unfortunately, we have to look beyond the numbers to see what is really going on.\n\nFor the past decade, the governments of the Netherlands, Germany, UK and others have allocated millions and millions of dollars into developing alternative energy. The German government has spent millions of euros installing solar panels across towns and cities, and everybody knows about the famous Dutch Windmills. The only reason that this industry has grown at this so-called \u201crapid\u201d pace is because there is an unsustainable amount of government funding behind it. And with the huge budget deficits in Europe and the United States, the growth of this industry does not look very promising. These companies are not profitable on their own, which is why very few investors (and institutions) make large bets on these companies. The start-up costs of building hydro-power turbines or windmills are incredibly high. One need simply to look at any public alternative energy company\u2019s cash flow; they are sitting on a pile of debt that will take years, if not decades, to repay. It is for this reason that Tufts does not and should not invest in these alternative energy companies. They are not profitable and will not help us grow our endowment, which is necessary for the future of our university.\n\nAn issue I have with this entire business is the limited amount of information that is perpetuated around the issue of climate change. I believe it was Benjamin Disraeli, a former UK Prime Minister who said, \u201cThere are lies, damned lies, and statistics\u201d. It is easy for us to accept a statistic; after all, it was Oxford University or the Institute for Climate Change (ICC) who conducted the research, and that in itself is a credential that allows us to blindly accept it as truth. I would urge a certain degree of cynicism when it comes to learning about such numbers and figures, for data is a fickle thing. Raw data and statistics is comparable to chaos theory (known colloquially as the butterfly effect). A tiny change in the data set  (inputs) can have disastrous outcomes on the statistics that are produced (output). Having had the opportunity to discuss this issue with climate scientists, I have learned that depending on the model being used, the resulting statistic (ie, the Earth\u2019s CO2 levels, the melting rate of the polar ice caps, the amount of infrared radiation, etc) can either spell out ultimate doom for all species on the planet, or suggest that we have little to worry about and ought to let things run its course. \n\nThe reality is, climate science is infinitely complex. There are so many variables that I have not yet discussed (the potential effect of aerosol from volcanoes, the algae in the ocean, the theory surrounding CO2 and the Ozone layer, just to name a few), but if one thing is clear to me, it is that there is much more on Heaven and Earth that is currently being discussed in the Divestment philosophy. \n\nI have no problem with social justice or mindful investing. I have no problem with individual investors and institutions, banks, mutual funds or governments that choose to invest in alternative energy. That is their business, and they have their own goals. The Tufts Endowment has one primary goal; to generate positive returns over time. That allows Tufts to achieve its primary goal, which is to educate students such as ourselves. \n\nThe Tufts Divestment movement have every right to protest, coordinate events and spread their message. My only hope is that their voice does not drown out the opinions of others. It is not my desire to wage war on this movement, nor is it to incite skirmishes across campus or on this page. What I want is for students to see and hear another opinion (perhaps a lesser-heard one) and make informed decisions. \n\nThank you for your time, and for reading. \n"', 'id': u'117787288404239_202076736641960', 'ids': [u'202076736641960_460477']}, {'created_time': u'2013-10-10T03:33:05+0000', 'message': u"I FOUND a white iPhone 4 in a lifeproof case with gold chains for a background texting someone named Christian Barker. if you know whose it is, comment on this post!

I was the last of my friends. I felt equally terrified that it would never happen for me and that I wouldn\u2019t know what to do if it did. I spent a lot of time wondering what was wrong with me \u2013 why I had missed out on this experience that everyone else my age seemed to have had. \n\nDon\u2019t worry about not knowing what to do. The concept of kissing seems so technical and difficult, but when it happens, it actually will come naturally to you. I never believed anyone who told that to me. But trust me when I say that you should not let that fear stop you from kissing anyone. They won\u2019t be able to tell that it\u2019s your first kiss. \n\nThere are so many people in the same situation as you. My two closest friends, also freshmen, had their first kisses just in the past couple of weeks. Before they told me, I would never have guessed. I think that\u2019s an important thing to know: that there are a lot of other freshmen walking around out there with the same concerns as you, thinking that they must be the last 18-year-old alive not to have kissed anyone. And it isn\u2019t true. \n\nSo kiss someone if you want to, my love. Don\u2019t be afraid of seeming inadequate. You\u2019re far from it. There can be power in seeking out an experience that you want to have, when you\u2019re ready, rather than waiting for it to happen to you.

It really is. You don\'t absolutely need to have friends. You don\'t need to have a constant group of people to fall back on. Thinking that you do is a problem in itself. Friends come and go, but you\'re always going to be stuck with one person: yourself. \nSo go on ahead, have fun on your own. When no one calls you to go out to dinner/frat party/concert/whatever, it\'s fine to stay in your dorm and do some quiet activities. Read a book! Doodle! Play the instrument sitting in your corner and remember why you brought it to college in the first place: back at home, you probably loved playing it even when no one was around to hear. Discover hidden talents and passions you never explored before because of your desperation to ""fit in"" and be surrounded by other people. Go for a walk around campus (the view from the library roof is stunning at night!). Jam out with your music! (When you\'re alone, no one can say how terrible your taste in music is. It\'s not, by the way. It\'s your taste and it\'s great). Go to the cafeteria alone and just enjoy the simple solace of drinking a nice cup of coffee or the pure delight of digging into that awesome awesome carrot cake without anyone remarking about your poor table manners because hey, who cares!\nTrue, you can enjoy other people\'s company, but it\'s way more important that you find a way to enjoy YOUR own company. Try to find some comfort in yourself before seeking comfort in others. For most of your life, you have always been pressured or felt compelled to be a part of some sort of group, a unit. In your isolation you can rediscover the individual that\'s been kept buried for so long. \nBeing alone isn\'t a curse; it\'s an opportunity.

Guys, I don\'t feel that way.\n\nI just support the idea of maybe understanding that while, yes, we should lessen our dependency on fossil fuels: \n\na) We shouldn\'t cut them altogether when 3/4 of our technology depends on it.  Yeah, we have wind energy and solar energy now, but that doesn\'t mean we can apply it to everything now.  We don\'t have the means of converting it effectively, and even when we do, solar- and hydrologocially-driven cars are still an issue because, well, for every 1 of them, there\'s something like 2,000 cars out there that still run on fossil fuels.  And they\'re way cheaper because we have made enough advancements in the engines to burn the fuel more cleanly.\n\nb) Just because Tufts invests in ""the fossil fuel companies"" (which ones, you don\'t know, but...FOSSIL FUEL COMPANIES), it doesn\'t mean that it\'s any less of a liberal-minded university, because last I checked, ""liberal"" means ""the opening of one\'s mind to all ideas for the purpose of general knowledge,"" not ""saving the earth without thinking that MAYBE the \'world-destroying traditionalist bastards\' have a point""\n\nc) And even if it IS less of a liberal-minded university because of it, it doesn\'t change the fact that, if it wasn\'t for the investments they made in the fossil fuel companies, you wouldn\'t be in college right now.\n\nI am not an economically-minded person when it comes to environmental policy.  Usually, when a discussion concerning fossil fuels comes up, I\'m all for trying alternative energy sources that can prevent greenhouse gas emissions and that will stimulate the economy.  I just HATE the fact that no one else is willing to see the other side, because I would love to debate with someone about this, but I don\'t want to be attacked for considering both sides.\n\nAnd if that makes me one of the ""World-Destroying Traditionalist Bastards"" too, than at least I\'m satisfied in the knowledge that in the hatred thrust upon me, I\'m the sole person who thought to look at both sides of the argument.  Last I checked, that\'s a more liberally-minded sentiment than any activist group could ever come up with.

And I understand that it is very difficult to make distinctions between social interactions based on race, and those based on gender. HOWEVER, in response to confessions from presumably non-white men, I would like to say this. When I am walking by myself, in broad daylight, late at night, on a busy street, or an isolated one, I am extremely aware of ALL men. White, black, hispanic/latino, old, fat, young, tall, short, suit-wearing, wearing sweatpants, all of them. This is something that comes with being a woman, it would be foolish to abandon the small, ever-present paranoia in the back of my head when I\'m walking alone. Seriously even 15 year old kids on bikes I am wary of. \n\nThat being said, I hope my self-preserving actions as a woman when I\'m out by myself are not misconstrued as racist when I encounter someone who is a different race than I am. I can only speak for myself when I say this, but if I am going out of my way to cross the street or walk briskly by you, it is frankly because I am a woman walking by herself in the presence of a strange man. Now, who am I to say where the impetus to cross the street comes from, gender differences, or race differences, probably a little bit of both. What I CAN say is that the world and culture we live in cultivates socially-loaded interactions like these. I hate how these inequalities exist, and how people act because of them. I hate the anxious anticipation I experience when crossing paths with someone who isn\'t white, because I am so terribly afraid of offending them by unconsciously displaying signs of racial uneasiness.

Not just a black man. It\'s not always about race.\n\nI agree with you. I don\'t get how people can expect women not to be anxious or fearful in a culture that constructs our bodies as public domain. No one can expect women to ""calm down about"" or ""just get over"" the constant appropriation of our physical selves- from cat calls to sexual violence to the portrayal of women and women\'s sexuality in public/political discourse and media. I\'m not saying that every woman should or does feel this way. But I am saying that some women (and certainly some male-bodied and trans and intersex individuals) do, and that we have every right in the world to feel like this. Calling this anxiety \'offensive\' creates a hostile, dismissive environment that silences and shames. If a person can\'t even be allowed to express anxiety about the possibility of sexual harassment/assault, how are they to express the actual experience? \nI don\'t think the original poster was talking about individual men. And I\'m not talking about individual men. The male-bodied figure I approach in the dark does (admittedly unfairly) become an embodiment of my anxieties about male entitlement to female bodies and my fears that if that shadowy figure did harm me, I would likely be shamed, dismissed, and blamed. I\'m not trying to say that men don\'t have a right to be upset about this. I think they very well should be. We should probably all be upset to live in a world where sexual aggression is naturalized and a large part of the population is told they do not have control over their own bodies, while simultaneously being told that they are solely responsible for protecting their bodies. I just wish that people would understand that when I\'m told that I am responsible for not getting assaulted, it makes sense for me to be anxious about being assaulted. \n\nBecause this isn\'t already long enough, I\'m also uncomfortable with ""it\'s not always about race"". I don\'t want anyone regardless of any aspect of their self/identity to harass or assault me. I think that\'s exceedingly valid. But... I do think every interaction we have is raced (and gendered and classed etc). And I think it\'s important to be aware of that so we can check ourselves and our assumptions and biases. But really, no one gets to strip me consumptively with their gaze and deign to call me whatever vulgar shit \'compliment\' they can shout out of a car window and act like I should be grateful for their approval of my existence and then hide behind their identity when I\'m rightfully pissed. So real talk, how can I tell people of all races/genders/classes/sexualities to go fuck themselves if they harass me?

What world did I live in that let me be happy to see everyone and anyone. To answer that question I need to tell you a little story.\n\nI am the youngest of three children and when I was young everyone I knew told me that I was my parents\' last attempt at reconciliation. Which to my 5 year old ears meant ""It\'s your job to keep the family together."" A task I accepted.\n\n It got harder as I got older because my sisters moved away. The eldest to boarding school so she could escape her screaming matches with mom. Then my other sister moved into my Dad\'s house because she learned how to manipulate him into doing anything she wanted. Which left me alone with Mom. \n\nNow 8 year old me trying my best to keep the family together because that was the job I was always told was mine. Over the years Mom got worse. She lamented her lost daughters. Oh how she cried for them being gone from her home. She never thanked me for staying though. \n\nOver time her sorrow hardened into a bitter hate. A hate directed at ALL her children. That was when she noticed me again. I was her verbal punching bag. Everyday she threw the cruelest words she could muster at me. Her speech slurred by  whatever cheap alcohol she could find that day. I took it all. Every harsh lash of her tongue.\n\nSchool was no relief. At school the social order was set by second grade. There was no changing after that. The ""cool"" kids made fun of the ""uncool"" kids. Needless to say I fell into the latter group. Made fun of every day for every mistake I ever made in school. In first grade someone saw me pick my nose and from that day on none of my classmates would go within 3 feet of me. They screamed bloody murder if god forbid they accidentally touched ""the nose picker.""\n\nEveryday was the same. I woke up to my alarms and my mother\'s shrieks about how useless I was to need an alarm clock and how she wouldn\'t be driving me if I missed the bus. Those times I did miss the bus more often than not I had to call a taxi to take me to school. Which only gave my tormentors both at school and home more fuel for their harsh words. Then I would come home. Make sure Mom was still conscious. Make my dinner, do my homework, and all the while be screamed at for every way I ruined the lives of everyone around me.\n\nThe few times I ever sought help from teachers, guidance counselors, my dad, my sisters, or anyone for that matter. I always heard the same set of responses. ""Stop making her so angry"" ""Don\'t do things the other kids can make fun of you for"" or as I heard it ""Stop causing problems""  Now I know those aren\'t the words that were used. But to my ears every response was the same ""You are a bad kid, stop being bad and don\'t complain anymore.""\n\nAnd that wasn\'t too far off from what my mother already said to me every day ""You are a horrible, rotten, demon child. You have ruined my life so completely. Why don\'t you ever go away? Why can\u2019t you just leave?"" Often said in much less kind words. Often said as she was being served whatever dinner I had made or being given some small token of her son\'s love for her. Because I really did love my mother despite how much she hated me.\n\nI went to my Dad\'s house every so often because it was my ""job"" to keep the family from falling apart after all. Time at Dad\'s was usually enjoyable for the first few hours... usually. Then my sister would stop being friendly. She had claimed Dad\'s as her\'s and my mere presence threatened that. Put simply, I learned how to dodge flying objects and my father learned plainly how to leave the room and let ""kids be kids.""\n\nNeedless to say over the years I grew deeply depressed. Both out of my own endless sorrow and the endless need to fear for my life, I slept with a knife. In fact I couldn\'t fall asleep unless there were at least 2 in my room. Every night before I slept I would take one of those blades and run it across my arm. Back and forth. Letting the edge of the blade press against my skin almost hard enough to break through. Back and forth until I felt calm enough to sleep. Knowing that it would only have taken that much more and I would have been free of it all. \n\nI thought about killing myself everyday. For years. There were times I was so close to doing it. Then I would think about what my funeral would be like, if there would even be one. And on those days I thought ""how many people would even show up? .... 3?... 4?\n\nThe thought of how pathetic my own funeral would be was the only thing that stayed my hand those days. ""Don\'t do it yet"" I\'d tell myself ""Wait until at least 5 people come"" ""Wait until you have done something good enough in this world that someone... anyone will miss you."" And so I would wait. Wait until I did something that would make others feel any sort of grief for my absence. They had made me so miserable that I wouldn\'t make them happy with my death. My revenge was to live.\n\nOne day, when had mom decided that words just couldn\u2019t convey her hate. As lay across a large padded chair doing my homework and we were shouting at each other about whatever awful thing I had done to deserve her wrath. And as the words grew more heated she stood up walked over to me and began punching me with all her strength. Not knowing what to do, I reacted. I kicked out at her. And as it happened my bent legs were right in front of her stomach. So when I kicked her she flew across the room, smacked against the wall, slowly slid down, and slumped. All this time letting out the most primal screech of pain you can imagine. I jumped to my feet and ran over to her, trying to help in anyway I could. She turned to me and screamed at me to \u201cget away\u201d. I couldn\'t tell you what happened next. I remember calling for an ambulance, and I remember her throwing the phone against the wall so hard that it shattered. All I can say for certain is that the next day she had a cast on her arm.\n\nAnd there it was. Proof of just how awful I was. What kind of child breaks their own mother\'s arm.. What kind of child would strike out at their own mother. How truly wicked did one have to be to willfully hurt their mother?  \n\nWhen it came time to go to high school my parents didn\'t want to continue \u201cdealing\u201d with the public school system. Apparently someone had noticed my sullen attitude and was starting to nose around the family. So I went to a private high school. I made a few friends there, but not much changed. I was so numb to the world by then I didn\'t even notice.\n\nMy life continued on this trend until I reached the age of 18. By then I had been so sad for so long I couldn\u2019t tell that something was wrong. I\u2019d forgotten what happiness felt like. I didn\'t know what it felt like to not hurt. All I knew was the emptiness. The loneliness that was my life. All I knew was that everything that everyone had ever told me was the truth. All I knew was that I was bad. I was an awful, terrible, despicable excuse for a human. I was useless, worthless, and a failure. My every action caused others pain and suffering. \n\nBecause that was all anyone ever said to me. And I believed them. Besides if I was so bad that my mother. The one person who is literally programmed to love you unconditionally. To love you despite any and all faults you may have. The person who is meant to fight for you at all costs. If she could hate me. I must be awful. Right?\n\nThat was the place I was in when it came time to apply for colleges. But some last little hold out part of me still believed. If just one school could find a way to accept me. Maybe someone there could see something in me, anything in me. Something that wasn\'t just plain wrong. Something that wasn\u2019t bad. Something in me that meant I deserved to be alive. Something that meant I wasn\'t worthless. Something that gave my life value. That someone might be able to show me that I didn\u2019t have to hate myself. Because I did hate myself, so much. So much more than you can ever imagine. But maybe, someone could find some reason why I might deserve to live. That my being alive was worth something. That m continued life was more than just an act of spite against all those so hated me.\n\nEventually mom finally tried to kill herself. And when I stopped her, she said everything to me that she had ever held back. Every retort that she had known would push me over the edge. Every wicked thing that she had known, but not said. The words that I\u2019d known she knew. The last thing that gave me hope she might...MIGHT... love me. But, with those words that hope was lost. Every last hold out part of me finally fully knew. At that point it was no longer a belief. I knew it as fact. The sky is blue. The grass is green. My continued life had no value...to anyone.\n\nFrom that day on I would lived at Dad\'s house because I had failed. I couldn\'t keep the family together and I was not going to listen to her anymore. I knew her words were true I didn\'t have to hear them anymore. I didn\'t want to hear them anymore. That night we packed up my stuff from Mom\'s house and I went to live at Dad\'s\n\nI didn\'t go to school the next day. But, on Tuesday Dad said ""You are going to school, stop moping around, you have to go to school."" And so I went. I had to sit through that day listening to people talk about how their parents hated them because, they wouldn\'t be allowed to go to such and such college to see a college Halloween party. Or they didn\'t get the newest ipod in the right color, so obviously Mommy and Daddy hated them. \n\nAll I could think that day was how much I wanted a hug. And always following that thought was the thought that I had made my mother want to die. Why in the hell did someone like that deserve a hug? \n\nEventually I confided in one of my teachers what had happened, what had been happening. It was the first time I had tried to talk to someone since 4th grade.  And there I was a senior in high school breaking down. In front of my math teacher. \n\nAnd he took me in his arms. Gave me a big hug and told me that if I didn\'t want to talk to anyone else, he would talk to my adviser and some of my other teachers about what was going on. Or if I didn\'t want him to say anything he would just tell them I was going through some hard times. Either way he would make sure I didn\'t have to worry about the tests coming up or the projects I had yet to start. \n\nMy math teacher told me I should talk to my physics teacher as well. Being someone skilled in math and science I often stayed after class to talk with my teachers. And apparently my previous math and science teachers apparently cared for me a great deal.\n\nI spoke to my physics teacher and when I finished telling my tale she too hugged me and told me that she would take me to look at colleges if I still wanted to because my parents didn\'t really try to do any of it. They didn\u2019t care.\n\nSo I talked to my teachers everyday and they helped me work on my college essays. I went home everyday to my dad\'s house and eventually Dad insisted I speak to a therapist, more than likely because someone at the school called home. Either way that therapist  was an idiot. She tried to form a ""bond"" by lying to me again and again. Whenever I caught her lying which was every time she tried, she would apologize and promise not to do it again, only to keep trying.\n\nEventually my applications were in and I was starting to not feel like crap all the time. I almost felt happy. By the time acceptances started coming out I had begun thinking that maybe just maybe one of the colleges I applied to  would accept me. That they might just see in me someone who was worth something. And I got in to 5 of my 7 colleges! I didn\'t even care that 2 places didn\'t want me because 5 did! 5 colleges. 5 separate places had read my applications and said ""Let\'s take him.""  5 different places thought I could be worth something!\n\nAfter thinking long and hard I settled on going to Tufts. I was decided to be a Jumbo! \n\nThen while we were getting yearbooks signed I got a phone call. It was Mom. Since apparently all her children hated her she was going to kill herself. And so instead of talking to what few friends I had. I spent the next 3 hours on the phone trying to get someone to go watch her or at least get her into a rehab center. Finally my aunt relented and agreed to go. \n\nBy high school graduation I could smile without it being a lie. I could look someone in the eye without wondering how much they hated me for being a waste of space. I could look someone in the eye and believe that they saw a person. I could believe that others saw me as having value in this world.\n\nSummer 2012 marked the first time since I was 8 years old, that I was happy. It had been so long I didn\'t even recognize it at first. I thought I was sick for 3 days before I realized that no, feeling warm and fuzzy inside did not mean that I was sick. It meant that I finally wasn\'t. \n\nAnd then I came to Tufts.\n\nThere you are. So in answer to your question as to what dream world I live in. I live in this wonderful place where other people can be happy to see me. Somewhere where people even WANT to hang out with me. \n\nYou ask how I can be so happy. How can I not? A world where I\'m not universally hated to me that\u2019s a better world than I had ever hoped to live in. That\'s how I can live everyday with a smile."', 'id': u'117787288404239_197097013806599', 'ids': [u'197097013806599_436464']}, {'created_time': u'2013-09-25T16:18:48+0000', 'message': u"Logan-- you're a freshman girl from TN and we kissed friday at a party and i cannot for the life of me find you on facebook or otherwise. can you please like this or get tagged in this so we can get back in touch??", 'id': u'117787288404239_197096823806618', 'ids': []}, {'created_time': u'2013-09-25T02:02:51+0000', 'message': u'I am a liberal but I am just plain embarrassed to be one when college activists do something really disruptive and uncalled for as a way of protesting.

Ace solidarity, whoo whoo.  But yeah, my experience hasn\'t so much been that there\'s a stigma against asexuality as much as there just isn\'t much awareness that it even exists or proper understanding of what it is. Hell, I only discovered that asexuality was a thing after being here for almost three years, and that was because I happened to stumble across something online. The invisibility is just as difficult though, just in different ways. I definitely know exactly where you\'re coming from about how LGBT events (and other events too) frequently seem to be hypersexualized, and it\'s been a huge source of frustration for me. From what I gather though, I\'ve heard that people from the LGBT center have been trying to be more inclusive and ""ace-friendly"" (they actually put out an informational video last spring). I feel like most of the people at Tufts are pretty open-minded, and the real problem is just that they don\'t know we exist (and by extension, a lot of aces probably don\'t even know they exist, which is how I was up until fairly recently). I\'m hoping maybe we can do something for Ace Awareness Week in October.\n\nMeanwhile, if you\'re looking for community and/or other cool aces to talk to or hang out with, there\'s a Boston-area ace meetup group that has monthly brunches and other fun events."', 'id': u'117787288404239_196961800486787', 'ids': []}, {'created_time': u'2013-09-25T02:00:38+0000', 'message': u"Am I the only one annoyed with Calculus?

They hate Greek life and everything it stands for, except when someone from Greek life comes out and criticizes Greek life for being too traditional/rowdy/fun.\n\nReal talk: As a senior, I think most Tufts fraternities are very accepting of gays, and most (all?) have had gay members. However, it depends what you want from a fraternity. Fraternities are a really good way to find hetero lifemates and meet girls, and not a very good way to be a part of the ""gay scene.""

And since you\'re at Tufts, you\'ll probably be spending more time studying than covering yourself in alcohol and your own vomit anyway.\n\nAEPi: isn\'t that far behind, but the fact that it\'s a bit farther away from the center of campus makes it less vocal about it\'s frat-bro-ness. But it\'s about the same kind of mentality as Zeta or 123. A bit more catering toward the vomit and International students than the other two though.\n\nDTD: Generally the ""old money legacy"" frat. If your dad was in a frat and that\'s why you\'re in a frat, that frat was probably DTD. DTD (along with Theta Chi) tend to be more politically minded, so you\'ll get a lot of wannabe future congressmen in DTD.\n\nZBT: So you want to be in a frat but also really don\'t want to be in a frat?\n\nTheta Chi: definitely caters to the ""Activist""-y side of Tufts. If you\'d like to be in a very socially aware frat, that\'s probably where you\'d want to go. Can be alienating because of that to certain crowds. Maybe stay away if you don\'t want to put ""changing the world"" above everything else.\n\nDelta Upsilon (DU): Historically associated as the ""date rape"" frat because of a seeded history with... well date rape. Mostly caters to football players.\n\nSig Ep and Sig Nu: If you\'d really like to be in a frat but don\'t want people to realize you\'re in a frat except for the fact that you talk about it all the time, thats where you go. Apparently they exist here. Like actually. Check the Wikipedia page for Tufts. SigNu and SigEp are there. Yeah I didn\'t know that either.\n\nATO: Co-ed and mostly for water sports. They don\'t have a lot of money because they\'re not nationally recognized, but if you do sailing or swimming or diving or anything else involving water, you\'ll be sure to mix a lot of alcohol with that water at ATO.\n\nChi Omega: So you wanted to be in a sorority?\n\nAOPi: ""I guess sororities are kind of cool."" If you came to Tufts not wanting the sorority life but changed your mind when you realized you were mostly hanging out with guys and wanted some female friends.\n\nAlpha Phi: Not nearly as vocal or personality-oriented as the other two.

I\u2019m happy you found my post so thought provoking but it also seems you assumed a lot which is my fault for being so pithy so I\u2019ll expand. I wouldn\u2019t mean it as a compliment, it\u2019s not designed or contrived to make her feel better it is the statement of a fact. At no point did I insinuate it was done for my benefit. I don\u2019t even know how you assumed I thought she should be pleased because no individual or group has a predetermined or unanimous reaction to anything as you have proven. I simply stated that girls make me happy sometimes, and yes I say girls and boys instead of men and women, personal preference and not sorry about it. This is not a form of validation and I would never be so narcissistic as to assume I had the power to validate or even affect another individual. I noticed you had no problem speaking for all girls though. I am not looking at them as people? You seem to assume I don\u2019t know these girls like a shared joke wasn\u2019t the reason for the smile, like the sense of style wasn\u2019t what started our first conversation. Lastly I find girls attractive. I am sexually attracted to girls and I won\u2019t impose my sexual desire on anyone hence why I tend not to just say these kinds of things that can be linked to it even if sexual desire isn\u2019t what I intend but I am absolutely not going to apologize, or be ashamed of the fact that I find girls attractive even if the reason I am attracted is not up to your standards of why I should be attracted to someone. I understand your method of thinking but to impose a criminality on a sentence you read is a stretch. Also I like how you assumed I was a boy, I\u2019m sorry \u201cman\u201d. And you\u2019re welcome!\n"', 'id': u'117787288404239_193461280836839', 'ids': [u'193461280836839_422240', u'193461280836839_422479']}, {'created_time': u'2013-09-15T23:15:46+0000', 'message': u'What does the fox say?', 'id': u'117787288404239_193451094171191', 'ids': [u'193451094171191_422525', u'193451094171191_422165', u'193451094171191_422371', u'193451094171191_422235', u'193451094171191_422189', u'193451094171191_422148', u'193451094171191_422151']}, {'created_time': u'2013-09-15T23:15:42+0000', 'message': u'to that cute greek guy i met... when am i gonna see you again?', 'id': u'117787288404239_193451074171193', 'ids': [u'193451074171193_422446', u'193451074171193_422157', u'193451074171193_422288', u'193451074171193_422139']}, {'created_time': u'2013-09-15T23:15:37+0000', 'message': u"I used the brilliant way you treated me to give kids a positive example of how those above your social stratosphere are not all tormentors of your life.

I understand that you would mean this as a compliment, but it\'s only reinforcing the idea that women (we are women, by the way, not girls) are ornaments for your viewing pleasure. Saying that these things make your day sets up her smile or outfit or beauty as directly correlated to your happiness. As if the reason she did it was to please you. As if even if that wasn\'t her reason, she should be pleased that you approve of her. Human bodies and human movements are beautiful. But they don\'t exist for you. We do not need your validation to move through the world and you do not have the power to validate us.  \nStop looking at us as beauty. Start looking at us as people, as embodied souls full of joy, sadness, love, pain- as complicated beings that go way beyond a sundress.

I\'m ""a girl,"" and I\'d feel pretty uncomfortable if I was told you ""preferred"" me tied up! BDSM requires a huge amount of trust and communication between partners. This isn\'t to say you shouldn\'t try it! But first, educate yourself. There\'s plenty of information online from reputable writers in the BDSM community on basic principles that are meant to protect everyone\'s safety and mental health - take advantage of it! There\'s also plenty of advice on how to bring up the subject with a potential BDSM partner. My own advice: Don\'t try it with ""a girl."" If you have someone in your life who you trust to be honest with you - friend with benefits, girlfriend, whatever - she probably won\'t suddenly start being creeped out by you if you broach the subject gently, making it clear that you have her consent, enjoyment and well-being in mind at all times. If you & your partner can\'t have an open, honest conversation about it, you definitely shouldn\'t be doing it - but if you can have an awkward, embarrassed, honest, giddy, excited conversation about it, you could be on your way to a great time. And don\'t be devastated if she\'s not interested!

Also thinking your experience encompasses all of the black male population at Tufts is a bit narcissistic. Either way as a black man I\'ve found being myself when I pursue girls or just interact with them casually has attracted and repulsed women of all races and even if you\'ve gotten rejected because you were black I can 100% guarantee assuming all white girls are racist will not make you more attractive to them. Also keep in mind they don\'t have to send an emissary to hook up with you to not be racist because they aren\'t an organization that had a meeting on whether or not they liked black guys and you are not the deciding factor.

Colorblindness is not PC; color-conscious policies such as affirmative action are PC, because people are too scared of being attacked to question it.

There are plenty of other sorts of people who are marginalized, uncomfortable, etc. (an example that comes to mind almost immediately is people with mental/emotional health issues and the like, although I\'m sure I could come up with more), and the message that the current system sends, in my opinion, is that those people and their issues aren\'t important enough to even be recognized, and makes it rather difficult if not impossible for these people to form communities to help each other the way the groups who have centers are able to.

We generate multiple millions of dollars every year just from my area and it all just seems to disappear into this mysterious "annual fund" which is basically the university\'s wallet. The fact that Tufts (and other universities) continue to jack up the price of tuition when they have millions if not BILLIONS in their endowment is, to me, the greatest crime our universities commit. I\'m not a "socialist" or anything like that but my experience has been totally disenchanting regarding the concept of for-profit (read: "private") institutions of education. It has begun to seem like nothing more than a giant pissing contest for who can wield the greatest monetary clout, build the best and biggest buildings to "prove" that we\'re a high caliber school and to attract even more investors to garner even more money. I get that everyone who works for us needs to get paid, we need classroom technologies etc. but the level of money gained vs benefit for the students do not seem to correlate AT ALL. The fact is that a college diploma is barely worth more than a high school diploma 20, 30, 40 years ago. Who decided that high school was necessary enough to be a civil liberty afforded to every citizen but its ok for students to be burdened with hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt for college?

Women are allowed to want to bang none of their friends, certain friends, or all of their friends, depending on what they want to do."', 'id': u'117787288404239_152650261584608', 'ids': [u'152650261584608_239556']}, {'created_time': u'2013-05-17T21:06:07+0000', 'message': u"If people knew how many times I've peed myself out of drunkenness...

That\'s the short of it here\'s the explanation. Guys who are actually nice and get friend-zoned often get friendzoned because they don\'t show intent. You can be really nice to a girl and still have her know you\'re interacting with her on the basis of sexual interest it\'s just that more often than not they are also shy and anxious and refuses to take the chance of being turned down in exchange for the chance to be accepted so they take the low risk approach of being just friendly. They then delude themselves, and I\'m sorry if it sounds harsh but I\'ve been there and its true, into thinking that the girls reacting positively to friendship means she showing signs of sexual interest when in reality she doesn\'t know you like her because you haven\'t put yourself out there as a sexual option. A good way to judge this is if you two were alone in a room she should think there is a good chance you will try to seduce, touch, or kiss her BASED ON YOUR PAST INTERACTIONS. Don\'t wait for a serendipitous event when all the stars align and everything is perfect. The low risk approach of just being friendly is actually the high risk approach because you become friend-zoned. The high-risk approach of showing intent is actually the low risk approach because even if you doing something as low risk as saying, ""you look beautiful in that shirt."" something only slightly forward as a friend could also feasibly say that. And she says, ""WOAH, what are you doing? Oh my god you\'re hitting on me. Why are you hitting on me. I can\'t handle this."" Which I hope you can realize is an unfeasible and unrealistic reaction. Just respond with something like it\'s a shame a girl as pretty as you isn\'t more used to getting hit on. You can even add on something like sorry if I startled you. Say it confidently and she can\'t rationally still continue on that tangent and will probably be flattered. However, an even better solution is to just be yourself, however cliche it sounds and here\'s why. Not being yourself around a girl you are attracted to indicates a lack of self worth which is very unattractive and will come off in all your interactions as you are basing your interactions on the principle anything you would naturally do is not good enough. Secondly, anytime you have success acting as a persona of what you thing you should be you are more likely to be cheated on or have a short term relationship because you can\'t be someone who isn\'t you forever and the ingenuousness and inconsistency will make her attraction to you inconsistent. Thirdly when you confidently act as yourself, surprise!, you attract people that actually like you and this applies to friends as well. You\'ll attract friends and significant others, sorry I have been saying girls it really applies to everyone, that you are happier around because you can be yourself, not second guess what you are saying and not have to deal with maintaining a persona. In the end I have said way too much and not enough people who should read this will but it\'s all things real nice guys should hear. For those of you who put on a nice persona because you think the real you is too mean, hardhearted, etc. being yourself even if it\'s not ideal is more attractive than being a pandering liar. If you thought this was worth reading like it so others will take the time to read it, I\'m not getting any credit so it\'s not for me. Still it\'s understandable if people don\'t read this since I\'m sure as hell not going to proofread it, man I went on forever XD."', 'id': u'117787288404239_152650054917962', 'ids': [u'152650054917962_239538']}, {'created_time': u'2013-05-17T21:04:24+0000', 'message': u'Fuck those who say they "can\'t stop eating."

I cannot stress how much of a big deal to me this is. I have been trying to be on Tufts Confessions for years, but that has not been possible until this amazing day. Hopefully my good luck will continue, but this is undoubtedly a rare occasion. If you asked me how i did this, i would say, you can achieve anything u set your mind on.

Thanks for posting that.  It\'s funny because I generally naturally judge people based on their personality and potential, not on their race or culture or whatever.\n\nIt\'s funny because the only thing that I see happening with the current status quo is that different groups get marginalized.  They say that Aspergers is the new black.  I couldn\'t agree more.\n\nIf you have Aspergers it used to be that you were considered smart or even a genius and that people would hold you in high regard: the engineer, the scientist, the brilliant writer, the doctor.\n\nIt\'s funny because in high school I never had trouble with making friends.  People often told me I was the smarted kid they knew and girls loved my ""classic good looks"" At Tufts I\'ve felt so much discrimination.  I\'ve looked at people who looked back with hatred in their eyes.  I\'ve felt pressured to kill myself.  And as far as being considered good looking, I\'ve only heard it from other men, whom unfortunately are not my gender of choice.\n\nMy grades suffer from the depression I feel.  I\'ve seen plenty of shrinks who reiterate what others have said: ""you\'re a genius""  I started medicating myself with ketamine (I\'m the same poster as the one who recommended its use earlier.)  But sometimes, on particularly bad days, even that is useless.  I\'m so desperate to belong.  I just want to feel like I\'m part of a community instead of ostracism.\n\nMy favorite is when I talk to people about this.  They consider my behavior an act, like I can just stop being myself.  They look at me and there\'s no sympathy.  It\'s not like a skin color where it\'s obvious.  It\'s more fickle and thus easier to discriminate.  I\'m certain that no minority has ever felt shunned by a Professor.  I have.  I\'ve gone and talked to certain professors and it\'s like they are offended by my intelligence.  The treatment I get is usually pretty standard: no email responds, rude and unpleasant office hour visits, insulting remarks towards ""stupid"" questions.\n\nSorry I just needed to get all that off my chest.

I belong to a minority, and I find the concept of the culture or themed houses pretty upsetting. I love the fact that Tufts provides these spaces in the hope that they are going to make the transition into college life easier for minority student. However, I can see that most of the times this is not what happens. All these houses and all other resources offered for minority students do little more than providing a ""shelter"" for students to continue putting themselves down and continue perpetuating the notion that minorities have to be given ""special treatment."" I came to Tufts as a transfer student, and it was not easy for me to adapt to college life being both a transfer and a minority. To be honest, I never actually adapted. However, I am ok with that, because the way I see it, it was somewhat my decision. I believe that it would have been very easy for me to simply go to my respective culture house or culture center, or culture club or culture whatever, and try to make friends there because people are the same color or speak the same language as I do. However, WHY SHOULD I? Why should I perpetuate the notion that I can only make friends with people of the same racial background? I\'m not saying that I don\'t like or refuse to be friends with people who belong to my same minority, not at all. I am saying that they are not the only people I can be friends with. I embrace diversity in the beautiful sense of the word. I love diversity where there are no distinction of what color you are or what language you speak. I love diversity where a person gets the same rights, treatment and opportunities regardless of what they look like. I don\'t like diversity where people\'s differences are accentuated, and the separation between whites, blacks, Asians, Hispanics or any other minority are openly claimed and given a special home. I strongly believe that culture houses and centers promote ""self-segragation,"" even if strong supporters of the houses don\'t like the term. Any space that lends itself for people to continue separating themselves from the rest of the crowd based on the race, language, ethnic background or any other ""defining"" characteristics is only harmful to society, and in this case, to the Tufts Community. One of the saddest things for me here on campus is when I walk into DeWick or Carm or any other open space, and I see a table full of students of the same race, and even sadder when I see them somewhere else, because I know that they only interact with each other. I don\'t even know why the heck I am writing this when I have a final to study for, but I wanted to state my opinion here, and hopefully have people fighting over whether I am right or I am an ignorant asshole. Let me finish by reminding you that I belong to a minority here on campus (actually 4, if I were to be technical about it), so I would ask that you get your head out of your self-segregated backside before you call me an ignorant.\n\n-Peace"', 'id': u'117787288404239_149651951884439', 'ids': []}, {'created_time': u'2013-05-07T21:21:21+0000', 'message': u"Senior here.

I\'ve never been in one of those spaces and felt unwelcome, although, like any new social group, it was obvious that I wasn\'t one of the crew. Again - it\'s not my crew to be a part of; there are other places to socialize with non-straight white males. \n\nHowever, I think that the relative dissatisfaction of some straight white guys is this: if Tufts students (who are by all accounts some of the most learned, sophisticated, and cosmopolitan students in this country) can\'t seem to get race relations right, who can? I have many friends who consider themselves part of one minority group or another. Why does it seem that so many minority groups are frustrated with the climate on this campus when my relationships with the minority students I\'ve gotten to know are so fulfilling? I understand that not everyone here makes it as much of a point as I do to seek out people with experiences different than my own, but I think many do. Still, it\'s really disheartening to think that the atmosphere has come across as so unwelcoming. I think that that had led some people to jump to the wrong conclusions and assume that people who socialize with white people less are more inclined to be unhappy with them (as if they haven\'t had to hitherto interact with white people their entire lives). \n\nI don\'t know what the answer is - I think there is groupthink on both sides, I think there is a tendency to over-analyze these interactions on both sides and look to far into one particular data point or another, I think there are many who are apathetic on both sides, and I think there is room for a more honest appraisal of where everyone actually stands vis-\xe0-vis where we perceive them to.

Our culture houses (although \'culture\' is not the appropriate term) are not segregated...everyone is welcome...but they provide a space for marginalized groups that may otherwise be left out from greater activities on campus. Groups like these certainly do not detract from diversity on campus. It\'s the idiots like you that question their validity that detract from our diversity. Admissions should make a concerted effort to improve student and faculty diversity and the administration must do the same with regards to diversity of of funded programs, departments, events, and student groups.""""""""\n\nI call bullshit, and you didn\'t disprove the first person\'s point. If there were no culture centers, then there would be more interaction between people of different backgrounds, which is supposedly the point of """"diversity"""" initiatives. You can say that the centers are """"for everyone"""" until you\'re out of breath, but nonwhite students are aggressively recruited from matriculation onward to become involved in their respective culture centers. Ask George Wallace if he\'d prefer separate but equal """"Africana"""" facilities, or if everyone (white and nonwhite) should just be encouraged to use the same facilities. To ask the question is to answer. As for me, I\'ll stick with integration and inclusion. E pluribus unum.""\n\nThere is absolutely nothing wrong with culture houses. You obviously have no idea how difficult it can be to come from a different country in terms of the transition and culture shock, and your ignorance disgusts me. Do you think people are comfortable being a minority here if they grew up in a different cultural environment? While I am not part of a culture center, I understand that the culture houses are simply another way of helping students integrate into a new environment and feel at home by finding people with similar backgrounds and interests, while educating the rest of Tufts community about their culture as a body. It provides minorities with support groups and a place to turn to when they\'re homesick. And it\'s only racist if the intent of culture houses is to purposely isolate people based on ethnicity for harmful or immoral purposes, so don\'t even try to mention separate but equal facilities. Even if new students are ""aggressively"" recruited from matriculation onward, it is ultimately their personal choice to stay. Dare I say it\'s because they enjoy being a part of it? Also, I don\'t see how this recruitment process is any different from athletic teams or clubs that recruit incoming freshmen.

Seriously, it\'s not abnormal to have no relationship experience at 23. Also, if you do have depression, it can be even more difficult to make friends or get into relationships. People do pick up on ""I am depressed"" signals, and some people will drop you. You should make an appointment at the counseling center if you\'re really unhappy. They have honestly heard it all and can give you recommendations and advice better than random people on the Internet (like me!) can.

They can give you advice, and if needed, they can refer you to a psychiatric nurse at Health Services who can prescribe meds.

How can you let go of someone when you have searched for years to find them -- that perfect person -- only to have them stripped from you as fast as they came? \n\nI only pray now that I can lift myself out of this inescapable sorrow and emerge stronger and with fresh hope. But the strength to do so is nowhere to be found and I feel crushed by the brutal weight of these feelings. And it hurts deep knowing she told me she doesn't want me back anymore. If only there were words I could say to make her understand, to show her I care, to ask her to give me the chance I've been waiting all my life for, to let me make her my queen. But such words do not exist, and if they do, I am incapable of finding them.\n\nLife will go on, as it always does, and new people will come and go, but I will never forget her. And I just hope that one day maybe she too will look back, think of me holding her there in my arms, the happiest I've ever been, and smile. \n\nAfter all, what is life if you have never learned to love? What is love if you have never learned to lose?", 'id': u'117787288404239_145925222257112', 'ids': []}, {'created_time': u'2013-04-26T06:48:40+0000', 'message': u'One time on a first date a guy told me a story about another first date he had been on from a dating website and apparently the girl had some sort of physical defect that he didn\'t know about until he met her.

Honestly, I don't think I would like them much.  I know women, including several that I like a lot, but the only places I can really meet people are at clubs and other interest-based groups, and I've heard and read so many women saying that they don't want to be approached at those things.  I don't want to make anyone uncomfortable, but where else could I possibly meet people I would want to be in a relationship with?  I also don't make friends very easily, so I'm terrified that I might alienate the few people I am close to if I were to say anything.\n\nAnd how do you say that kind of thing to someone, anyway?  I hear that most people can gauge interest and gradually escalate things by reading all sorts of signals, but I can't do that.  It's medically impossible.  I can't even flirt.  Hell, I can't even recognize flirting; I just know it as a word other people throw around sometimes.  I really wish I weren't expected to be the one to initiate things; it would make all of this a lot simpler.\n\nI don't even know why I'm writing this.

Though I sympathize with your condition, in order for you to say that with confidence, I think you don\'t understand the full potential of severe mood disorders.  I don\'t point this out to you with resentment, but you are perpetuating an ancient stigma, and I can\'t abide by it.\n\nI have bipolar II disorder.  Very few people know this about me, and very few would suspect it.  As far as most other people can tell, I function normally, get good grades, and am highly involved on campus.  To an extent, the hypomanic energy that comes with my illness fuels my art and my writing.  It\'s a better high than any drug.  When my mood is stable, the world is beautiful and full of meaning, and I\'m happy.  My depressive episodes, which have lasted as long as a few months, have given me that perspective.  \n\nMost people do not realize that severe depression decimates your cognitive functioning, causes physical pain, and brings on an emotion many people only understand in the most abstract sense: anguish.  To put it in perspective, I am relieved when I merely feel "sad," because it\'s better than the crushing void of depression.  Most people do not understand that episodes come and go like the weather, and that you can\'t think your way out of them.  Most people do not understand that these are latent genetic conditions triggered by stress, not the unfortunate result of a bad attitude, and are unable to fully separate them from personality disorders.  So I sympathize with you there, and I understand your "grey fog."  I\'ve felt it, too.  But you\'re wrong about suicide.\n\nMost don\'t understand why someone would ever commit suicide, except to run away, in cowardice, from some kind of obligation in life.  I can understand why they think that.  If you have never experienced a mixed bipolar episode in which you had a sudden, extended impulse, brought on by excruciating anguish, to throw yourself under a train, as I\'ve had, you really would have no reason to understand.  But my impulse had absolutely nothing to do with rational thought.  There is nothing in my life, when my mood is stable, that would for a second cause me to think about ending it.  I love my friends and family, and they love me.  I am an incredibly lucky, overprivileged person, and I love my life.  \n\nSo I ask you, would you have called me a coward for succumbing to an impulse that was an aspect of my illness?  Do you condone the other morbid suicidal impulses that have flashed and sometimes lingered, unwelcome and unwanted, in my head?  Did you know that almost half of people with manic depressive/bipolar illness attempt suicide, and something like 20% succeed?  Major depression is nearly as life-threatening.  It would be a hell of a coincidence if all of those people were cowards. \n\nps  I really hope you find a treatment that works.  And please don\'t completely rule out medication.', 'id': u'117787288404239_145919725590995', 'ids': []}, {'created_time': u'2013-04-26T06:22:44+0000', 'message': u'Never did I believe that you were that reserved, soft spoken kid while in the most boring class on the face of this earth.

They seem like they don\'t care about their fan base any more, only posting once or twice a week and not updating their schedule. Hell, they only posted about their final show of the year (this week) a few days ago, leaving fans no time to rearrange plans or ask for time off of work. I feel like I\'ve been listening to the same songs at every performance. I\'m pretty sure I\'ve watched them do "Everybody Talks" at least a dozen times with only one or two new songs. They just don\'t seem to represent "Fun Through Song" anymore. I\'m not sure if it\'s because there are no graduating seniors this year or if all the guys have been too busy to care, but they just aren\'t the same any more.

I\'m the one who can\'t move past.\n Here\'s what I would say: I think that these events of the past week have just shown me that all I can do is try a little harder to be a little nicer because I am so lucky to have all that I have-- a safe home with so so much love surrounding me-- and so many people are lacking that in life. So all we can really do is spread our love and our positive energy to as many people as we can so that their lives, as much as a struggle as they are, can be a little brighter, and hopefully they will not be as sad. It\'s hard to remember, but it is very comforting to realize that warmness and acceptance are sometimes the greatest signs of strength. And for that reason, even though I am scared if i become friends with you again, I will be hurt and then disappointed all over again, I forgive you completely and I ask for your forgiveness. So let us be friends, and I will work to accept you for you. \n\nI wish I could say that, but here is the confession: I have too much pride. I am too afraid. I can\'t let my guard down.

If paying $600 (plus exorbitant interest) more in student loans is the price I have to pay to be an ally than so be it. But it would just be really really nice to have a transgender student who plans on using this new health amenity comment on this confession and tell me that they appreciate me taking on this burden for them.

If you\'re worried about turning into a zombie, that doesn\'t actually happen--that tends to be anti-pharma people trying to scare people away from drugs. \n\nThings to be careful of: never let anyone prescribe you atypical antipsychotics unless you have schizophrenia. (Common ones are "abilify" and "seroquel".) The research around it is shaky at best, and they can cause agranulocytosis (when all your white blood cells die off, not permanent but extremely dangerous) or tardive dyskinesia (repetitive, involuntary movements like those seen in Parkinsons patients, can be permanent). I\'m letting you know because I\'ve seen psychiatrists who didn\'t tell me about these risks, and when I asked about these side effects they said it "wasn\'t a big deal". Thankfully I knew about these risks beforehand, otherwise I wouldn\'t have known and might have taken them.

I\'m white, and I\'ve heard many friends express this. Let me share my story with you. I came into Tufts with a pretty good understanding of who I was. I was happy with my life, fairly optimistic about humanity, had a ton of people who I loved, and who loved me back, and definitely NO white guilt or awareness of the role of race and racism in my life. My priorities and perspectives have since changed dramatically, largely because of the classes I have taken. Sometimes I think of how easy it could be to be one of the other kids who took Race in America and then forgot about it... Or you, whose liberal sensibilities make you not racist, right? But I can\'t think like that anymore and I never want to! Yeah, I get annoyed with myself for feeling tired after a few years of more learning than activism. How do you think People of Color feel after a lifetime of fighting it every day? Yeah, I feel like a selfish pessimist when I complain about my "struggles" as an affluent white soon-to-be private college grad. Yeah, I DO feel white guilt sometimes. Yeah, I\'m going to leave Tufts a little more depressed, cynical about humanity, overwhelmed by the amount of internal reflection and changes I need to make in myself before I can contribute to the world in the way that I want to, and feeling very alone. Call it white guilt, tell me I should\'ve picked a different major, ignored what other people "jam" down my throat... But I wouldn\'t give up what I have learned for the world. In fact, they are some of the most important lessons I have learned in my life. It\'s not these Tufts kids that you hate so much that are creating the injustice in the world. They already exists. We\'re just trying to raise awareness of it and actually challenge it. Read, reflect, and don\'t be afraid to join us.\n\nYou say you don\'t need to learn these lessons, but what are you doing to combat social inequalities? What do you know about them and where have you learned it? What was your school like? Or your neighborhood growing up? How easy is it for you to get an internship somewhere? How many family members do you have in prison? How often do you feel unsafe? What about threatened by rather than protected by the cops? What does it mean to be "Black" in America? What do you associate with "Asians"? Are they stereotypes? Try reading Peggy McIntosh\'s Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack and really think about the privileges you and and whether or not you have "earned" them or if you were born with the "right" skin color. Or Sue\'s article on Microaggressions. These don\'t require the Critical Race Theory vocabulary to understand them. \n\nBut take it from me, a white girl, you should try to listen.', 'id': u'117787288404239_143827455800222', 'ids': [u'143827455800222_186724', u'143827455800222_186723']}, {'created_time': u'2013-04-18T23:51:46+0000', 'message': u'RE:"I don\'t think Wilderness knows how much it hurts to be on the outside"\n\nSome of Wilderness does know how much it hurts to be on the outside.', 'id': u'117787288404239_143827359133565', 'ids': []}, {'created_time': u'2013-04-18T23:51:30+0000', 'message': u'To the guy who was working at Tower tonight, you were cute, and really friendly.

At least extremely cautious. During an extremely dark period of my life, I was prescribed wellbutrin because I had heard nothing but great things and my dad takes it and it works great for him and I had read that a side effect was weight loss which was a huge plus for me. It made everything a billion times worse. I sank even lower into my depression to the point that it consumed my life completely but I didn\'t realize it was the drug\'s fault so I kept taking it, thinking it just needed some time to take effect. I was desperate because the thing about depression is once you\'re there, you never think you\'re going to be not depressed. You think that\'s the way it\'s going to be forever. There\'s no light at the end of that tunnel. Eventually it was explained to me that prescribing anti depressants is basically a huge guessing game. Every drug affects every person extremely differently and there\'s no way to know how any of them will affect you until you\'ve taken it. Pretty soon after that I was prescribed prozac which I hesitated for months to take because I didn\'t want the same thing to happen again, but eventually I did it and it worked great. Depression gone. \nSo my advice to you is to be very careful and tell someone who spends a lot of time with you that you\'re going on a new anti-depressant so they can tell if your behavior changes. Good luck.', 'id': u'117787288404239_143048862544748', 'ids': []}, {'created_time': u'2013-04-15T23:29:38+0000', 'message': u"I thought you were a good guy, and you seemed really swole.

Who the hell ARE you?"\n\nI\'m just some dude on campus with some skills that are in demand by a lot of people.  People go to me when they need help with things, school related or otherwise.  People tell me I\'m good looking, no one has complained about my skills in bed.  I have a lot of friends all over campus.  I go to gym a lot, people know I\'m in very good shape.\n\nI posted that so that people who have trouble with women might find a little comfort knowing that it is difficult for most people.  You just got to keep your chin up and stay positive.  \n\nI know there are guys out there who have it easy with girls and cheat and all that.  I\'m just trying to say that those skills are tied to personality, not looks, skills, friends, or anything else for that matter.  Just personality, ego, being the party.  Remember that boys.\n\nI came to the conclusion that the reason for all this pain, ridiculous partying, infidelity, polygamy, and generally inhuman behavior is the corporate structure.  Corporations need people to be unhappy with their sexual lives.  They need it because in many cases, intelligent, skilled people; i.e. the back bone of corporations, are in short supply.  These people are generally unhappy with their love lives.  Think about it, dumb people seem to have no problem with women, or they just rape them and society turns the other way, perhaps on purpose.  The leader personalities have no problems with women either.  It is really the intelligent, driven, professional types who might never succeed with women.\n\nEnter the modern corporate structure.  Typically, in large campuses around America, all of the small nuisances are taken care of for the young professional.  There are social functions that give this individual\'s life some meaning, and perhaps a chance to find a nice young lady.  As men enter their 30s this desire becomes paramount, because human beings are driven by their genes to procreate.  Ultimately human beings want to help each other and leave behind a world that is better for their children.\n\nCorporations are not people, they are however, legal entities designed for one function: to earn profits.  You can read it in their charters.  Companies are incorporated to earn money.  This fact is the reason that corporations have no trouble destroying the ecology of the earth.  It is the reason that corporations have no qualms about going into foreign countries and installing tyrannical dictators who murder their own people, i.e. Africa, or funding leaders that have no regard for the working conditions of the population i.e. Asia.  \n\nI posted that small blurb so that maybe intelligent people at Tufts, the very people that corporations absolutely need in order to profit, will think to themselves: maybe the reason for my unhappiness, the fact that I cannot succeed with women is because of the corporate structure of America, and not any fault of my own.  \n\nOnce people realize this we can begin to dismantle our current unsustainable structure and build a new structure.  One where assets like sexual attractiveness will not be controlled by corporations but rather by the holders themselves.  Yes I am talking about prostitution.  \n\nIn industrialized countries where prostitution is legal, e.g. Germany and the Netherlands, the homicide rate is one tenth that of the U.S. and CO2 emissions per capita are 60% lower then that of the U.S.  Prostitutes are given free health care and are registered in national databases.  They are provided with protection by the police, provided that their working areas are up to code.  They pay taxes, which the government uses to ensure the safety of both the sexual workers and their customers.  \n\nOnce the population of this country wakes up to the fact that giving control of the sexual capital to the corporations is leading to an enormous homicide rate, human trafficking, and the destruction of the earth\'s ecology, we can give this capital back to the hands of the people who own it, women.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this.  The answer to world\'s problems is not to reduce individual freedoms, but to expand them, while reducing corporate freedoms.  Corporations are not people, they are entities, before any freedoms are taken from the citizens of this country they should be taken from its corporations.  As the illustrious George Carlin once said: "I don\u2019t understand why prostitution is illegal. Selling is legal, fucking is legal. So why isn\u2019t it legal to sell fucking?"  Hopefully the answer to that question has been explained adequately in the above text.', 'id': u'117787288404239_142704905912477', 'ids': [u'142704905912477_179288', u'142704905912477_179273', u'142704905912477_179317', u'142704905912477_179278']}, {'created_time': u'2013-04-14T21:14:06+0000', 'message': u'RE: "I sometimes feel really angrywhen I see Townies, or people who just don\'t belong in Tisch... we pay for the resources there, why can they just come in for free?"\nStop crying and get over it.

You help save the last remaining tree in your neighborhood from being destroyed. You clean up a vacant lot so you and your friends don\'t have to play baseball in the streets. You get stuck downtown with your best friend dressed like fruits. You help the strange kid in your neighborhood leave his stoop. You help the crazy ice cream man realize he can do whatever he wants. You meet your favorite baseball player Mickey Kaline. Your only real worries are avoiding the school bully and losing your favorite blue hat. Next minute, you are engaged to a girl who used to call you football head just to tease and make fun of you.The Sunset Arms Boarding House is emptied quickly after Elementary School. The Kokoshkas, that is Suzie and Oskar, they divorced and went their separate ways about the time I was in 6th grade. Suzie went on to be a teacher, Oscar ended up becoming the owner of a moderately popular website that sells all sorts of gags and gifts. Last you hear of him, he still does his work lazily and half-assed, just like he did when he lived a few doors down from you. Ernie Potts ended up severely injured on a worksite and became paralyzed from the waist down. After winning a huge lawsuit against the demolition company he worked for, he was able to afford his own house somewhere on a lake. After I was able to find his daughter on Christmas that year, Mr. Hyunh helped to put her through school and get a college degree. Apparently, he had been saving all of his earnings for something, but he didn\'t know what to spend it on. After she finished her degree, the both traveled back to Vietnam to visit their homeland before returning and opening a business.Grandma died when I was 15. Grandpa was devastated at his loss, and he wasn\'t really the same afterwards without her. She was a big part of his life, as well as mine. He was the last remaining border in the house, and told me time after time that I will inherit the Boarding House when he passed away. I wasn\'t sure what I would do with the old place when he passed, but I don\'t know if we would have enough boarders to keep it open. He lived a very long and fulfilling life. The day he died was gravely hard for me. I tried to give a memorial speech for him at his Wake, but found myself unable to do so. This happened earlier this year.The faces around town sure have changed as well. Harvey the Postman is now the Head Manager at the Post Office for our district. We don\'t see him on routes anymore; instead we have a grumpy old man who doesn\'t like to mingle whose name is unknown to me. Mr. Simmons is no longer a teacher; instead he is the school counselor, and he makes it his mission to help students out of any crisis they may find themselves in. Mrs. Vitello, the flower shop owner, passed away earlier last year after having a stroke.Gerald was accepted into a major university somewhere out of state. We keep in contact, but only the occasional text message or weekly email update or facebook status change. Sid and Stinky were contracted into doing a show for a local channel, which aired for about 3 seasons. Everyone loved it, and now they are producing more television shows rather then star in them. Eugene ended up winning the lottery, ironically enough. The unluckiest kid in school became one of the luckiest people alive. He is living off his winnings happily with a girl he met at community college. Most of the other kids from class, Brainy, Phoebe, Curly, Lorenzo, Lila etc, well, they either moved away or lost contact with me. I still see Herald about town every now and then, seems he is getting ready to buy Mr. Green\'s Meat Shop and continue work as a butcher.Then there is Helga. Well, her story is pretty sad. Helga and I started our relationship over in high school. In about the 6th grade, out of nowhere she stopped with the relentless name calling and bullying. I noticed a drastic change in her about this time, and did not know what had caused it. It wasn\'t a gradual change either, but something had completely shifted seemingly overnight. Shortly after, her father was convicted for some sort of felony involving his failing company Big Bob\'s Beepers and sent to prison for many years. I don\'t remember what it was exactly, but Helga\'s mother and her moved to a different part of town and she was pulled from the PS 118 school system.High school came and in 9th Grade we were placed in the same Public School System again. She was back in our district and was different\u2026. extremely different. Her once pretentious attitude was diminished. Her boisterous voice was weak. She was sad, melancholy if you will, and seemed depressed all the time. Her appearance, vastly different from what I remembered, was also uncharacteristically askew. She no longer kept her hair up, but rather down and untidy. She dressed in clothes that seemed too big and dirty. Her general appearance was that of extreme poverty. The only time she seemed to show even the slightest sign of life was when I was present. When she would see me, her face would light up for a split second, and I saw the Helga I remembered from elementary school. Something inside me did a flip-flop when this would happen. I realized that I had missed her during the years she had been absent.My senior year I asked Helga to Prom. She said yes. That night is still very vivid to me. When I picked her up, I was amazed at the state of her house. The place was filled with garbage, no tidiness as I had perceived Helga from her younger days to live in. The who atmosphere of her home was that of uncaring and gave a general feeling of disgust. Her mother did not seem to notice or care that she was leaving, or that I was even taking her to a Prom. I guess a normal mother would be radiant, taking pictures, absorbing the feeling. Even though her house was a terrible mess, when she came down that staircase, she looked stunning, as if she had sold everything to rent her beautiful dress. Donned in a tight fitting blue smock, glittering with shines of light blue, her image would be engrained to me until even this day. The night was filled with dancing, good times, and ended with a kiss I will not ever forget. Something came back to life in her that night. She did not want to go home, so I didn\'t take her back. That evening, we sat up on the roof of the Boarding House and watched as the sun rose over the city.After High School graduation was about the time she moved into the Boarding House with me. Grandpa had his own room, and I had my attic room still, slightly modified from my Elementary Days of course. After seeing the vast change in her persona from Prom, I knew something about me completed her. When she moved in with me, she brought very little, but did not want to retrieve anything else. A small car full was all that she had ready, mostly clothes and other small knickknacks. Helping her move out of her mother\'s apartment was depressing. All her mother did was sit on the couch, smoke cigarettes, and stare emptily at the television set. Few short words were exchanged, and Helga informed her mother that she was moving out, from which she did not receive an encouraging response. After she was settled into my room, she told me her whole story.It\'s amazing how much can change in ten years.She started in fourth grade, how she had obsessed over me, loved me from the day she met me. She kept my picture in a gold frame on her at all times, hidden from anyone else to see. She sometimes made small idols of me. She wanted me more then anything, but couldn\'t find the strength to tell me, for fear of rejection. She instead turned that desire into teasing, the only route she knew to utilize. Her home life was terrible. She lived in a constant shadow of her older sister Olga, the perfect daughter in her mother and father\'s eyes. She told me how she was constantly reminded of her older sister\'s success, and how she was never given any credit for any good thing she ever accomplished, simply because it wasn\'t good enough. Her mother was ditzy, and her father was controlling.When she turned 14, the sexual abuse from her father began. Big Bob Pataki was a deviant, and hated the fact that he had a second unwanted daughter. After Helga was born, he forced his wife to have a female vasectomy of sorts, called a tubal ligation, so that another unwanted child was impossible. When his wife told him that she did not crave sex anymore, he decided instead to turn on Helga. She told me how she always knew he hated her existence, but was stern in the fact that it was just a tedious idea concocted out of jealousy for her sister, but when he started the abuse on her, it became clear that she was right in her horrible ideals.She said it lasted for two years, up until he was charged with Fraud and Avoidance of Federal Funds from the IRS. She recounted about how he would do terrible things to her at night, when her mother was asleep. If she fought, she would be punished physically. He was sentenced to 30-50. After her father was sentenced and placed in prison, she tried to consult her mother about the things that had been happening. She never did before her father went to prison, simply out of fear of what would happen. Sadly, even though she tried to find comfort in her mother, she was only met with a heartbreaking disappointment. At her telling me this, I could see her eyes well up with tears. Her mother did not care about the happenings with her father, and she even speculated that it was her mother who recommended her father abuse her. She said that she felt her mother had also grown to hate her daughter. She told me that those two years were suppressed in darkness. She stated that she couldn\'t remember the details if she wanted to. All she knew was that she went from being perfectly happy to wishing for death each and every night. The tears became too much, and started to roll. Then she started to cry.She lay sobbing in my arms for a good 3 hours. All those years of wondering what was missing, why Helga had left, where she was and if she was doing okay, I discovered this horrible truth. She sobbed and sobbed, crying out years of pain and anguish. All this time she had nobody to console, nobody to talk to, nobody to be a friend when she needed it most. All the time I could only hold her head on my shoulder, stroke her arm and tell her everything was okay. I told her that things were going to get better. She stopped for a second, whispered to me "I know. I have you now. Everything I have ever wanted is right here, in you." She then lay her head back down on my arm, and promptly fell asleep.It\'s amazing how much can change in ten years.As she slept peacefully on my arm, I wiped the remaining tears from her eyes. I kissed her on the forehead and let her rest. I began to close my eyes in the emotional strain of things. I heard too much, I felt too terrible. I just wanted to get some sleep. Thoughts and feelings of radical natures plagued me. I was devastated, angry, torn, completely paining for my dear Helga. The horrors she had endured are too much for any one person to have to deal with in one lifetime. I decided it would be best to sleep. Just before I drifted into unconsciousness, I heard her whisper "I love you so much...footballhead."Helga is better now. Any and all sorrow she had that night was cried away, and drifted into nothingness. She is happy, happier then she has ever been in her entire life. Always I knew there was something odd about her. She always seemed too keen to go out of her way to antagonize me. Looking back at it now, I realize it was her way of asking for some attention. I love her equally to what she loves me, more then anything I have ever loved in my entire life. I asked her to marry me about 4 months ago, and she said yes. In due time, we will be newlyweds.Thinking back, its humorous to me now. I used to dread sometimes going to class for fear of what mean things Helga would do to me. Now, I can\'t stand to be away from her. I lay here now thinking about life before she found her way back to me, and can\'t remember anything. Is this a testament to the idea that a man isn\'t truly complete until he finds his soul mate? Has Helga always been the person I was destined to be with? I like to think that she is.It\'s amazing how much can change in ten years.', 'id': u'117787288404239_142401875942780', 'ids': [u'142401875942780_177776', u'142401875942780_178820', u'142401875942780_178331']}, {'created_time': u'2013-04-13T23:23:57+0000', 'message': u'Until last night I thought "nads" was slang for boobs.', 'id': u'117787288404239_142401809276120', 'ids': []}, {'created_time': u'2013-04-13T23:23:49+0000', 'message': u"We don't talk, we don't even make sense, but I'm addicted to your body so I'll keep calling you over.", 'id': u'117787288404239_142401799276121', 'ids': []}, {'created_time': u'2013-04-13T23:23:38+0000', 'message': u"I love my roommate, she's great.

There are both men and women who don\'t like to conform to this but guess what... Neither the gross man who won\'t eat a girl out or a gross girl who won\'t give blow jobs is going to get a a lot of action. Coming from a girl (who doesn\'t like the pain and hassle of hygiene as much as any other girl), waxing my hair, putting on makeup, looking generally attractive and putting out is a common courtesy to my boyfriend. If I didn\'t hold up my end of things what right would I have to ask him to look good for me? And what right would I have to expect him to stick his face in an unkempt vagina? EW. And beyond everything I would just be embarrassed with the way I looked. It is simple... If you want to feel confident in your sexuality and have others like you for it then look and act the part. This is about courtesy for your partner and pride in yourself.""\n\n...Because God knows you can\'t have pride in yourself if you don\'t get that bikini wax. \n\nNo, I don\'t mind a great deal of this argument, but ""look and act the part"" implies that there\'s something wrong with the way you are naturally. You keep saying ""pride in yourself"", but you\'re also ""embarrassed"" by yourself. And if you think that, that\'s fine, you\'re not alone. But there are a whole lot of women and men who either don\'t give a damn or (gasp) actually like it. \n\nYou do you, but as someone who has no idea who you are, I can point out the fact that you\'re buying into that idea that your vagina is somehow gross, when, honestly, it\'s probably quite awesome. ""EW"" indeed.\n\nMore importantly: ""putting out"" is NOT ""common courtesy to [your] boyfriend"", it is something you enjoy doing, not so that you can keep him or get him to do what you want him to do, but because you fucking like having sex with the boy. Your vagina is not a commodity, it\'s just your vagina. Own it, because nobody else does. No one.

In fact I think that\'s the completely wrong way to go about it. I think it\'s much more important to realize how unimportant beauty really is. I much prefer recognizing that I am fairly mediocre looking, and just realizing that it\'s frankly not that important. In general I think it\'s important to recognize reality and put it in perspective rather than lie to yourself. For example, I think that the entire girls\' self esteem movement (and in practice it is mostly focused at girls. Btw, I\'m a guy, so this perspective is biased) should focus instead on saying, ""who gives a shit if you\'re not pretty? That\'s not what matters."" \n\nWhat\'s fundamentally wrong with the ""everybody is beautiful"" approach is that it places an emphasis on a trait which we cannot control. A meta-study analyzing 30 years of data (http://www.parentingscience.com/effects-of-praise.html) found a few key elements in how to praise children for best results (read the article for a definition of ""best results""). One of those elements: ""Praise kids only for traits they have the power to change."" Studies have found that when kids\' inherent abilities are praised, they become cautious to failure, avoiding challenges. They learn that their abilities are inherent and unchangeable. ""Kids might also get the message that intelligence or talent is something that people either have or don\u2019t have. This leaves kids feeling helpless when they make mistakes. What\u2019s the point of trying to improve if your mistakes indicate that you lack intelligence?""\n\nAnd so it is with emphasizing beauty as a positive attribute. The more we tell ourselves (or others - children especially) that we\'re beautiful, the more we believe that beauty is a positive, worthy trait. And then when the day comes (which it often does) when we realize that our beauty is not up to standard for whatever task (this could be anything - making a good first impression, appearing attractive to people at a club, whatever), instead of doing the smart thing and trying another route (using our talents to make a good first impression or our personality to appear attractive), we give up since we have learned that the important thing is a trait which we can\'t change - why would we bother trying if we know it won\'t help?\n\nI spend a very small amount of personal time and energy on beauty - maybe 45 seconds every day to shave and find a shirt that doesn\'t have a ketchup stain. And you know what? It makes me happy. REALLY happy. In fact, I\'ve found that paying attention to by beauty MAKES ME SAD. On a normal day, I get up, do my thing (shower, brush teeth, etc), put on my clothes, and after that\'s done, I don\'t think about it again. Not once during the day. And that makes me so happy. I am completely care-free when it comes to beauty. I just don\'t think about it. But on those occasional days where I decide to put on something nice, I feel like shit the entire day (and yes, I\'m mixing fashion and beauty here, one of which I do have some control over, but that\'s besides the point I\'m trying to make). I\'m constantly worrying about how it looks and will I spill something on it? I\'d better be extra careful not to. It drives me nuts, and there\'s no good reason for me to do that to myself.\n\nIf instead we emphasize in ourselves the things which we can change - the skills we can develop, the things we can learn, the ways we can choose to come off to other people - then we will be much more successful. And beyond that, we will be happier and more of our own selves. Think of how much more we can differentiate ourselves and be unique individuals if we evaluate ourselves based on personality and interests than on looks. I mean, how many different looks are there? I haven\'t counted, but there can\'t possibly be that many. Instead we should define ourselves by the content of our character; by our values, our thoughts, our actions, and our deeds. For those are things which we have the power to change, and indeed the things whose furtherance and study are worthy social and human endeavors.\n\nAnd to extend off of that last sentence, is beauty even a thing worth pursuing? I mean, artistic beauty, sure. Architectural beauty, fine. Even beauty in fashion - why not? But personal physical beauty? I don\'t think so. What do we gain from increasing our physical beauty? Sexual attractiveness and its various associated benefits are really all I can think of. And do we as a society value sexual attractiveness that much? Ok, bad question - of course we do. But should we? If it\'s purely about physical attraction and procreation, then focus on personality. I\'m far more turned on by an attractive personality than an attractive body. As the great Jon LaJoi once said in his masterpiece, ""Show Me Your Genitals,"" ""I can\'t stick my penis in your college degree."" In fact, I quite disagree - I\'d much rather stick my penis in your college degree than your genitals, metaphorically speaking. And anyway, sex aside, don\'t we have better things to spend our time on? Girls reading this - how much time do you spend on your looks every day? I\'m talking makeup, beauty products, and clothing (unless you\'re a fashion-as-art person - that\'s a different ball of wax). Now imagine if you were able to spend that time doing something more productive, even just for your own personal soul-satisfying benefit? We\'ve raised generation after generation of girls who could otherwise be spending time doing useful, interesting things to contribute to society to instead spend it making sure their eyes look like they\'re perfectly almond-shaped (is that even the right shape? Shows how much I know).', 'id': u'117787288404239_116448961886217', 'ids': [u'116448961886217_29563', u'116448961886217_29536', u'116448961886217_27971', u'116448961886217_27787', u'116448961886217_27756', u'116448961886217_27481', u'116448961886217_27588']}, {'created_time': u'2013-04-11T23:12:29+0000', 'message': u"I'm a guy and I really wish I could just find a girl I could cuddle with.", 'id': u'117787288404239_141657746017193', 'ids': [u'141657746017193_173580']}, {'created_time': u'2013-04-11T23:11:06+0000', 'message': u'If I had to say which band I hate the most, it would definitely be Maroon 5.', 'id': u'117787288404239_141657409350560', 'ids': [u'141657409350560_175102', u'141657409350560_175166', u'141657409350560_173850', u'141657409350560_174162', u'141657409350560_173849']}, {'created_time': u'2013-04-11T23:10:28+0000', 'message': u'I would fuck Professor Panzer in a second', 'id': u'117787288404239_141657289350572', 'ids': [u'141657289350572_173537']}, {'created_time': u'2013-04-11T23:10:13+0000', 'message': u'What you do speaks so loudly that I cannot hear what you say.', 'id': u'117787288404239_141657239350577', 'ids': []}, {'created_time': u'2013-04-11T23:09:57+0000', 'message': u"As appealing as the idea of Tufts Crush is...

I've received a pass from the athletics department here long ago to use the gym after speaking with them about hopefully playing college basketball. I DO NOT SNEAK IN. I've met many fraturnity brothers who have INVITED me to their parties on Saturdays. I'm not some townie that crashes eveything that goes on here and starts trouble how else would I be able to get in if I don't go here? I come I party, I leave nothing more, nothing less. Because brothers have thought I was cool and told me to come out.  Back in high school I actually lost my virginity to a girl that went here. We started hooking up on a regular basis. I somewhat got a bit attached to her and wanted more. I wanted a relationship but she didn't. Needless to say I was oblivious to the college hook up culture being so young. She said because of the fact that I was two years younger then her and I wasn't going to a prestigious school such as Tufts she couldn't see me as anything more then a hookup buddy. At first I didnt mind this but then I started questioning myself. Am I not good enough? So after graduating high school and enrolling in a small college in Boston. I still used this campuses' resources to aid me with my transfer process to hopefully on of the public ivies, Notre Dame, Upenn or here. I've lied to numerous people here about where I really attend because being a college student that doesn't go to a school like Tufts yet I felt judged like I was before, especially as a minority. I'm not some big, bad, scary Tufts creeper like many have portrayed me to be. I've burnt many bridges through lying here and to those who where my close friends that I haven't been so honest with and I'm sorry. Lying is not okay and there is no valid excuse for it. I realized through talking to many students here that if someone can't accept you for who you are then that person doesn't belong in your life. I'm at Eaton or Tisch till close because I have a dream. A dream of being just like you guys and getting into a prestigious school but not for the girl I was with from here back in high school, but to prove to myself that I have what it takes to be successful and someday get into medical school.

Don't get me wrong, privilege is a real sociological phenomenon, and it has its time and place. It's totally appropriate to discuss it within an academic, large-scale context. You should not, however, talk about privilege in a social activism context on an individual basis. It's not that it doesn't have factual grounding. It's just that it's the totally wrong way to frame the discussion you want to be having. It is just not a good way to establish a constructive dialogue. It's inherently divisive as a concept, and inevitably leads to misunderstandings and people being alienated. Telling someone they have this or that privilege is not going to make them want to help your cause. It is going to make them feel like they have to justify their own problems. Instead of making it about who has it easier or harder than others, try making it about being good people and treating others with respect. It's not a contest.

In this manner, piss would not splatter on the toilet seat but would fall into to bowl."\n\nComments following included:\n*discussion about manners\n*point about women and men use the seat down\n*lame joke\n\nManners aside, let\'s look at this from a physics standpoint; when a girl needs to pee and its up, all she has to do it tap it and let gravity take the seat down. But when a guy has to pee and its down, he has to lift the seat up, exerting force opposite to the convenient force of gravity, requiring a torque on the seat and work to be exerted. The energy used to lift the 0.5m 0.5kg seat hinged on one side from horizontal to vertical over 90\u02da(\u03c0/2 radians) is roughly 1.96 J or 2 joules. Looking at just the U.S., the AVERAGE (clearly there are exceptions, but for the sake of math) household contains 2.6 people, or 1.3 males. Assuming that each time the men and women in that household pee the seat is in a position in which it must be moved, and that the average person goes pee on average 5 times per day and probably go 3 of those 5 times at home every day, a total of 6 joules of energy are used per household per day by lifting the seat. Clearly that is not very much at all, but seeing as there are approximately 115,000,000 households in the US and 365 days in a year, each year just over 250 billion joules of energy is used in the US just to lift up toilet seats. Obviously not all of this energy loss can be avoided, as there is a 50% chance that a woman will put down the seat to use it, but keeping the seat up as a man will allow there to be no need to lift the seat for the next person, as there is a 50% chance that a man will use the toilet next, and if a woman uses it, the force of gravity will do the work. Seeing that there is a 50% chance that the person who used the toilet last is a woman and there is a 50% chance that the next person to use the toilet is a man, we can negate 25% of the total energy used to lift toilet seats, seeing as it is inevitable through probability that the seat will have to be lifted. So 75% of the energy is avoidable, a total of 190 billion joules worth of avoidable energy loss in this country, which converts to 180 million BTU, the energy of 5100 cubic meters of natural gas. The annual U.S. consumption of natural gas is 25.46 trillion cubic meters so 5100 is only (2.00 \u202210^-8) %...... Shit, i was expecting it to seem like a lot more energy... but still, it\'s a lot.\n\nYa, that definitely wasn\'t worth the effort of figuring all that out.\n\nalso hmu.', 'id': u'117787288404239_140317562817878', 'ids': [u'140317562817878_164593']}, {'created_time': u'2013-04-07T22:31:26+0000', 'message': u'I wanna bang the indian kid in tilton', 'id': u'117787288404239_140317512817883', 'ids': [u'140317512817883_164775', u'140317512817883_164553', u'140317512817883_166068', u'140317512817883_165193', u'140317512817883_164554', u'140317512817883_165191', u'140317512817883_164959', u'140317512817883_164872', u'140317512817883_164677', u'140317512817883_164585']}, {'created_time': u'2013-04-07T22:31:20+0000', 'message': u'That black Theta Chi pledge....

But don\'t ask me why I don\'t talk to those girls or call them back. Don\'t ask me why I\'d rather not have sex than have sex with them, and ask them to leave or leave myself when I discover they are "unkempt" or unreasonably, in my opinion, prude, not my favorite word but it works here just note I don\'t mean to draw on the socially establish negative connotation associated with hat word, in whatever way shape or form. While I won\'t make the presumptuous and erroneous claim that all tufts males think the same it\'s absolutely true most guys who I have talked to think the same ranging from guys who feel like"players" to guys who feel like "losers". Whether it\'s for just sex or a relationship I think sex should be give and take and personal hygiene typically makes it more enjoyable for your partner and shows that your someone who is sexually giving. I do many things I dislike such as exercise, put a razor to my ball sack to shave it, shower, shave, keep my nails cut, keep my ears clean, trim my nose hair, made sure I knew many methods of finding and stimulating the g spot and the clit through hours of embarrassing and tedious research etc. I\'m not obligated to do any of this but if two people go into sex with the mindset of I\'m going to do the least I can do while having everything go my way sex would be terrible. I know that many women are glad to proclaim they don\'t want a guy who thinks like this but honestly, when you like and guy and don\'t get why he doesn\'t like you back or are wondering why more guys don\'t hit on you and you don\'t take care of yourself that\'s a common reason guys, in my experience, won\'t like a certain girl, sexually. Even more common is the fact that those girls will never get told that that is the reason because lets be honest, if I couldn\'t confess this anonymously, I wouldn\'t even be saying any of this and most guys don\'t want to say something critically mean to a girl for any reason, in my experience. Feel free to deride and otherwise attack my confession just know that I personally don\'t care and your doing so is nothing more than a superfluous Facebook crusade for others or your own moral masturbation because as I have said, I don\'t care.

I was leaning against a wall at a party, waiting for my friend to text me so we could leave and go to a different party. This girl - clearly very drunk - comes up to me and asks me my name. I tell her, and ask her her name. She leans in really close, sliding one of her legs between my legs and pressing her body up against mine and whispers her name in my ear, and tells me that she wants me to fuck her. That\'s something that most people would think is sexy - my body obviously thought it was sexy, because I instantly got a pretty big boner. But I politely declined and softly pushed her away from me.\n\nNow I don\'t have a girlfriend, but I have been hooking up with a girl who lives on my floor who is a lot hotter than the girl rubbing up against me, who is pretty cute but not super hot. Honestly I just didn\'t feel like hooking up with a drunk girl at a frat party who was only moderately attractive. I just wasn\'t digging it.\n\nSo I said no. But she doesn\'t like hearing that (I\'m guessing she doesn\'t hear it much), so she comes right back up on me, and puts her hand in my pocket and grabs my dick. Says something like ""Why not? I can tell you want to!"" So I say ""Sorry I\'m not interested"" and push her back off. I look the other way and ignore her, but she grabs me again and tries to kiss me. Now I would never hurt a woman, but this girl is kind of crazy! I shove her off me again and try to leave. But she moves in front of me and blocks the doorway saying she won\'t let me leave when my dick is hard. Being about twice her size, I\'m careful not to hurt her, but I grab her by the shoulders, pick her off the ground and literally move her to the side. She lands safely on her feet, but I\'m done with this shit, so I get the hell out of the party. Haven\'t seen her since\n\nNow I don\'t really feel emotionally devastated or anything, because even though she violated me there was never really any threat to my safety or well-being, because I\'m so much bigger. But it\'s gotten me thinking about rape at parties and stuff. Was the only thing standing in the way of her raping me the fact that I was much bigger than her.

Clearly it is unacceptable for women to have any form of body hair. Now that you have brought to our attention how much a stray hair kills your sex-drive, we will proceed to shell out considerable sums of money on a regular basis so that strangers can pour hot wax on our bodies and subsequently rip out any offending hairs by the follicle. Such tolerance of hair as biological phenomenon can be regarded as nothing less than slovenliness. When it comes to sex, to present anything other than a shining, clean, child-like canvas would be insulting to the centuries of cultural views that women must be pure and virginal.\n\nHear, hear. This descent into squalor must be stopped. While most women have carefully calculated a z-score for their attractiveness and fitted it to a curve which calculates a requisite level bodily hygiene, this model is clearly inadequate to maintain an inoffensive appearance. Take a good look in the mirror, ladies. Your body or your lifestyle choices may be offensive. If you notice what I am describing, it may be easily solvable with fad diets, expensive beauty products, or, in extreme cases, plastic surgery.\n\nLastly, thank you kind stranger. There is nothing better than a brave man who has the courage to speak his mind directly to those who offend him. There is nothing better than hearing a man speak out about issues so critical to women\'s health, and there is nothing worse than a man who speaks his mind without first considering that what he says might not be as respectful as he believes.\n\nSincerely,\nTufts Women"', 'id': u'117787288404239_139867016196266', 'ids': [u'139867016196266_164280', u'139867016196266_164399']}, {'created_time': u'2013-04-06T16:01:06+0000', 'message': u'sometimes I like the smell of my own poop...', 'id': u'117787288404239_139866169529684', 'ids': [u'139866169529684_162089', u'139866169529684_162073']}, {'created_time': u'2013-04-06T16:00:49+0000', 'message': u'I\'m a straight male and I have no problem with guys sitting on my lap or vice versa, twerking, saying another guys is hot, or doing other things that might give others the impression that I\'m gay except that I feel like I\'ll have less success with girls because I give off too many "gay" social signifiers.', 'id': u'117787288404239_139866109529690', 'ids': []}, {'created_time': u'2013-04-06T16:00:00+0000', 'message': u'Guys at Tufts never make the first move and get mad when girls expect them to, saying "it\'s 2013 blah blah."

We started our tour and the university felt nice. Nothing special, they seemed to give the same general spiel as most places I had been. And then, just as we were passing the Jumbo statue, a small bird hopped off of the statue\'s trunk and soared directly overhead like a glorious B-2 bomber. Also like a B-2, it dropped a nuclear bomb-sized shit on my head. That was when I knew. In that moment I was euphoric, I was infinite, I was covered in bird shit.

I think you said a lot of great things, but I just wanted to comment on one in particular. "You don\u2019t have to be whiteness, be whomever you want to be. Whiteness makes that task easier for whites. Don\u2019t tell me it\u2019s not always easy for you and that we all have struggles, whiteness tells me about your struggles every day." There are some problems that transcend race and societal treatment, so please, please don\'t write off people who are struggling. I am a white male who comes from a reasonably well-off family. I have also been struggling with severe depression for a very long time. The past several semesters have been total disasters for me. I am a complete wreck, and in all likelihood I am going to be thrown out of school. I have been doing everything I can to try to get support and help, but I have had little success. My life is crumbling before my eyes, and I have no idea what is going to happen to me.

Whiteness tells me letting my hair grow out is unprofessional, Black men kill and get killed, and I\u2019m less-than. I can tell myself I am Puerto Rican, Black, gay, and working-class. I can tell myself every one of those things means I am love, I love myself, that I can be myself and I can be. But whiteness tells me no, certain parts of you cannot just be. They do not deserve to be. Maybe they can be, but be less because I am more. Yet whiteness today wants to tell me I have unlimited opportunity. Whiteness tells me I am free. My oppressor wants me to think that they have granted me freedom when it is only possible for me to free myself and them. So before you say:\n\nyou are tired of hearing it\nshe shouldn\u2019t have put herself in that situation\nget a job\njust enjoy life\nwhy does she keep having kids\nlearn English\nwhy did he leave his kids\njust exercise\nthey make me feel bad about being (insert oppressor)\nthey talk about every single little thing\nget over it\n\nBefore you say any of those things. Before you think any one of us is free.\n\nAsk me, \u201cAre you able to just be you? To just be?\u201d \nI\u2019ll say, \u201cNo.\u201d\nMaybe you\u2019ll say, \u201cWhy?\u201d\nAnd then we\u2019ll move forward, grow, learn. And love. Together.\n\nI am Benjamin Serrano.

Unless you want all our funding to go down and for financial aid to be cut, we can't just pull out sturdy investments like it's no big deal and hope our new ones work.

This is coming from someone who struggled with alcohol addiction for years.\n\nI am able to maintain my sense of dignity and go to class and get good grades because I modulate my drug use with the appropriate vitamins and minerals as well as neurotransmitter precursors. Alcohol, for example, is known to deplete magnesium and the b vitamin thiamin.  This can lead to depression.  Oxytocin, which is released during orgasm, is known to stimulate the release of endorphins.  You are addicted to these chemicals.  I suggest the amino acid: D-Phenylalanine, which inhibits the breakdown of endorphins.  You may consider limiting your use of cannabis, which can lead to depression in some people, remember drugs impact everyone differently.\n\nI hope you get your life back on track.

But I have to admit, in this little confession, that I am so unbelievably grateful that I got to hide out from the real world for a couple years and just learn and go to class and go to both really bad and really good parties, and hook up with foolish but harmless boys and make friends that don\'t know about domestic violence and addiction but don\'t give two fucks that I do either. None of that matters here, in a place where you can forget things and just be in the present and be like hey, my school mascot is an elephant. What? A place where even the "dumb jocks" are brilliant and everyone has so many plans and dreams. A place where TUPD cruises by every three minutes, giving you a little nod and smile, and if you\'re lonely you can just go to Hotung and watch the news and be surrounded by like minded individuals, all your own age.

When Tufts Confessions first came out awhile ago, there was a confession that read something along the lines of "Proud to go to a school where \'I\'m gay\' would be the most anticlimactic confession." I want to point something out. Not that I\'m unhappy that it\'s an \'anticlimactic confession\', I\'m glad people at Tufts are so receptive to people being gay, but I\'m not so sure we\'re taking care of people who are struggling to come out. I don\'t think \'anticlimactic\' is the right word to use. Sure, it may be anticlimactic if you\'re scrolling through Tufts Confessions looking for something juicy to read. But for someone who is struggling to identify their sexuality, it\'s anything but anticlimactic. Having someone at Tufts react as if it was \'anticlimactic\' can be very hurtful. Imagine coming out to a friend at Tufts and having them say something along the lines of "Cool, join the club. So many other people at Tufts are gay. What\'s the big deal? You think you\'re any different?" There\'s more to being gay than just coming out, and there\'s a lot of pain (and relief) that goes along with it. I personally feel that when some people come out at Tufts, some resources don\'t necessarily provide enough support or compassion for them. I think our campus as a community should be more aware of the way we look out for our peers and notice the little things that may be signs toward friends in distress.', 'id': u'117787288404239_136214023228232', 'ids': [u'136214023228232_139396']}, {'created_time': u'2013-03-27T14:40:50+0000', 'message': u'RE "I hate the way people at this school talk about social justice issues.

I guess that\'s messed up to say, but whatever.) I actually grew up with my dad\'s family, because my dad has all sorts of emotional issues and he bailed before I was born. So you can see, my childhood was really kind of messed up.\n \nAnyways, growing up I feel like there was always a lot of distance between me and my sister. When I was about 17 or 18 I first noticed that my sister was a hottie.\n \nI don\'t want to go into to many details about it, but basically what happened is that I accidentally found a video that she made of herself. I knew she didn\'t make it for me- but I thought she was so beautiful that I watched it twice. (probably would have watched it a hell of a lot more, except that like right around the time I found the video, all this crazy shit went down and I had to leave home. (My dad\'s family who I was staying with got in bad trouble with the law. I never talk about it).\n \nSooo... I was totally lusting after my sister at that point. She was also having bad trouble with the law. She was actually in custody when I left home.\n \nMy friend and I went to go pick her up. When I saw her that day, after seeing the video, I have to be honest, I just wanted to frak her brains out. Looking back on it now, it\'s pretty messed up- but I think she had feelings for me too. She actually kissed me right after we came to get her... and it wasn\'t a sisterly kiss, you know? I mean, it wasn\'t like ridiculously sexual or anything, but it definitely wasn\'t sisterly.\n \nAfter we left, we all went to crash with my Sister\'s friends. On the trip there, my friend sort of implied that he wanted to get with my Sister, and I got a little jealous. He\'s a good looking guy- and even though she was my sister- I just felt like he was competition. Not much else happened between us for a while except some maybe-sexy hugging.\n \nPretty much everyone in my life at that point was wanted by the government, so we all moved around a lot. I\'m not saying that I\'m proud of it or anything, but it was kind of an awesome time.\n \nMy friend and my sister never hooked up I don\'t think- but I thought there was some serious sexual tension going on between them. It was around that time that I got really badly hurt in an accident. It was messed up. I almost died. But when I was in recovery my sister came to see me, and out of the clear blue sky she started gives me this awesome, slow, passionate kiss on the lips.\n \nSadly (although, I guess for the best) nothing ever came of it. We spent some time apart... and I started to get really religious, so I tried not to think of her that way. It was actually going well for a long time- like I was totally over her. But I have to say, like a year or so after all that stuff went down, we were out sailing (not like a date or anything romantic like that), and she was wearing like the hottest bikini I\'ve ever seen and it brought back all the old feelings. Sigh.\n \nA little while later she actually wound up with my friend from before (the sexual tension guy). I can\'t say I was surprised.\n \nBut even after she was shacking up with my friend, there was one time we were at a party... my friend was inside, and my sister and I were outside alone. It was a really intimate moment. I think something might have happened, except that I killed the mood when I told her that Darth Vader was our father and that I had to go face him."', 'id': u'117787288404239_134199676763000', 'ids': [u'134199676763000_128510', u'134199676763000_128524', u'134199676763000_128534', u'134199676763000_128583', u'134199676763000_128606', u'134199676763000_128934', u'134199676763000_128999', u'134199676763000_129017', u'134199676763000_129341', u'134199676763000_129365', u'134199676763000_129536', u'134199676763000_129540']}, {'created_time': u'2013-03-22T21:48:49+0000', 'message': u'I smoke weed everyday and I have never been happier or more productive.', 'id': u'117787288404239_134199663429668', 'ids': []}, {'created_time': u'2013-03-22T21:48:36+0000', 'message': u'GUISE.

When referring to rape as a mistake someone has made, they mean it as a very serious error the person has made in their choices. We all make mistakes (lying cheating stealing etc) some are far more serious than others. We didn\'t accidentally make these mistakes (as a kid those baseball cards didn\'t fall into my pocket without my noticing as I left the store, I shoplifted them) we made poor choices that in many cases we regret and wish we could take back. Sometimes it\'s easier to forgive these mistakes (I am very sorry about those baseball cards) and sometimes it is far more difficult to forgive a mistake. And for some it is apparently difficult to understand that people are complex, and sometimes good people make mistakes, sometimes very serious ones. What doesn\'t help humanity or the world is closing yourself off from being able to forgive someone who has made a mistake, because people deserve forgiveness if they truly regret the mistakes they\'ve made and want to learn from them and grow into a better person. I choose to live in that world where every terrible wrong that someone commits is a mistake they can regret and try to be forgiven for, even if they have deeply hurt another person. I dislike the world you\'ve described where anyone who has ever committed rape is a bad person who will only rape forever, because that world seems like it would have a lot of permanent serial rapists.\nTL;DR Accidents and mistakes aren\'t always the same thing. People can change. Forgiveness is a virtue when well deserved."', 'id': u'117787288404239_134197466763221', 'ids': []}, {'created_time': u'2013-03-22T08:10:55+0000', 'message': u'You treated me like shit.
